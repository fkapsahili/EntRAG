To our investors,

You might expect a company’s year in review to open
with big numbers: how many products we launched,
how many consumers and businesses adopted those
products, and how much revenue we generated in the
process. And, yes, you will see some big numbers shared
in the pages of this report and in future earnings calls as
well, but 22-plus years in, Google is still not a conventional
company (and we don’t intend to become one).

And 2020 was anything but a conventional year.
That’s why over the past 12 months we’ve
measured our success by the people we’ve helped in
moments that matter. Our success is in the researchers
who used our technology to fight the spread of the
coronavirus. It’s in job seekers like Rey Justo, who, after
being laid off during the pandemic, earned a Google
Career Certificate online and was hired into a great new
career. And our success is in all the small businesses who
used Google products to continue serving customers
and keeping employees on payroll … in the students who
kept learning virtually on Google Classroom … and in the
grandparents who read bedtime stories to grandchildren
from thousands of miles away over Google Meet.

We’ve always believed that we only succeed when

others do. And that success is only possible because
of the incredible teams I have the privilege of leading
across Alphabet. Teams who, over the past year — at
home with kids on their laps and pets at their feet —
never stopped working to deliver on our mission and
our core pillars of helpfulness, trust, execution, and
supporting our partners. Teams who continue to create
sustainable financial value. Teams full of optimists who
believe in technology’s ability to make things better for
people and communities everywhere.

In the pages of this report, you’ll read about some

of the ways our products helped people, businesses,
and communities adapt and recover. I hope they’ll inspire
you as much as they inspire me.

Sundar Pichai
CEO of Google and Alphabet

A look at 2020

Across Alphabet, we found ways to help people,
businesses, and communities respond to a transforming
world — they weren’t just having to adapt, they were
learning to do everything in new ways. At Google,
our response was guided by three focus areas: helpful
products, trusted experiences, and supporting
our partners.

Helpful products
for an unpredictable time

In 2020, the world changed more quickly than ever,
upending how we live and work. Since the outbreak
of COVID-19, teams across Google have worked to
provide access to quality information and resources,
and launched more than 200 new products, features,
and initiatives. We wanted to meet people where they
are, provide the help they need, and keep them safe
at every step.

To support public health authorities around the

world in their fight against COVID-19, we partnered
with Apple to launch the Exposure Notifications System
(ENS). Designed to protect users’ privacy while helping
public health authorities and governments manage
their reopenings, the ENS enabled 50 countries, states,
and regions to build apps based on the technology.

Making essential information easily accessible in

daily life was paramount — we expanded the Search and
YouTube experience with knowledge panels featuring
local guidance and information about COVID-19
symptoms and prevention, and introduced the COVID
layer in Google Maps, a tool that shows information
about COVID-19 cases in an area to help users make
informed decisions about their travel.

As people searched for safe ways to stay connected

and productive, we made Google Meet, our premium
videoconferencing product, free for everyone; anyone
with a Gmail address could enjoy many of the same
features available to our Google Cloud business and
education users.

We also pledged over $1 billion to assist our users,

customers, and partners around the world, including
$450 million in Ad Grants to worldwide government
agencies like the World Health Organization (WHO). As
a result, we served over 2.6 billion PSAs from local public
health agencies — seen by billions of people globally —
to make sure authoritative information reached as many
people as possible.

Beyond solving for immediate needs, we were also
thinking about the future. Our 2019 quantum supremacy
milestone led us into a new era of quantum computing,
with the potential to take on challenges like designing
more efficient batteries or determining what molecules
might make effective medicines. But discovering practical
applications is not something we can do alone. That’s
why we launched qsim, a new open source quantum
simulator that will help researchers develop quantum
algorithms. By inviting researchers everywhere to join us
in this effort, we hope to accelerate the breakthroughs
quantum computing can make possible.

materials, and open source tools, and invites
researchers everywhere to join us in exploring
the power of quantum.

As much of our lives moved online last year, the safety
of our digital tools became even more critical. We
continued to put privacy and security at the forefront
of our products so that, every day, users are safer
with Google. Built-in protections across our products
worked proactively to keep digital threats at bay. Gmail
blocks more than 99.9% of spam and phishing attempts,
and Google Play Protect scans over 100 billion apps
for malware and other issues each day. We also made
a number of updates: Location History, Web and App
Activity, and YouTube History now delete automatically
after 18 months by default, and we enhanced Chrome
with Safety Check, an easy and intuitive way for users
to confirm they’re browsing safely. Our re-launched
Safety Center helped users explore how we protect their
privacy with one of the world’s most advanced security
infrastructures, and we made it even easier for them
to manage their online security — in 2020, we saw more
traffic than ever, with Privacy Checkup receiving over
1.1 million visitors per day and Security Checkup receiving
more than 3.9 million visitors per day.

We worked to keep misinformation off our platforms

by raising authoritative content and supporting quality
journalism. On YouTube, we expanded our COVID-19
medical misinformation policy to remove content
about vaccines that contradicts consensus from health
authorities such as the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) or the WHO. We also invested
$6.5 million to support fact-checkers and global
nonprofits combating misinformation, with an immediate
focus on COVID-19.

Last year, Americans also turned to Google to
find information on voter registration, polling locations,
election results, and more. “How to register” and “how
to vote” reminders across Search, Maps, and YouTube
were seen over 2 billion times. On Election Day, we
partnered with the Associated Press to keep users
up-to-date with real-time election results alongside
relevant searches.

In 2020, we announced our
largest investment yet to
support the future of news
with the launch of Google
News Showcase

12

Year in Review

When the world shifted to learning and working from
home, Google data centers kept us running, supported
users, and, crucially, supported our partners. Whether
our partners are developers, advertisers, content
creators, or merchants, our performance is only made
possible by their success.

For many of our customers, digital transformation
in the cloud became an urgent business priority in 2020.
Last year, Google hosted over a trillion minutes of video
meetings and over 2.9 billion users chose productivity
apps like Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides,
and Meet every single day.

Developers were behind the apps that kept people

entertained and connected while at home. To ensure
developers could access the latest information about
our products, and could connect with us and each other,
we pivoted all our major conferences online, including
11 weeks of developer content to support the launch
of Android 11 Beta. This gave millions of developers easy
access to the information they need to build their
businesses on Android and Google Play. We also released
new tools to help developers build more efficiently and
grow their business, as well as online training materials
to expand their learning.

The retail sector has faced many challenges
over the years, which have only intensified during the
pandemic. We made it free for retailers around the
world to list products on our Google Shopping tab and
removed commission fees for all sellers who participate
in our Buy on Google checkout experience. To help
retailers adapt to a new reality, we provided a real-time
view into search trends relevant to their business in the
Google Ads Insights page and made in-demand options
like curbside pickup and delivery central features in
Search and Maps.

Quality journalism and a vibrant news industry

remain critical. Our products give people choice
and help them find high-quality journalism — from
international stories to community reporting. In 2020,
we announced a $1 billion investment in partnerships
with news publishers and the future of news with the
launch of Google News Showcase, a product and
licensing program that will give local, regional, and
national publications across the globe the opportunity
to forge deeper relationships with their audiences
through a richer news experience.

Every month in 2020, Google helped
drive over 2 billion direct connections,
including phone calls, requests for

reviews for American businesses.

16

Year in Review

Even early on, it was clear that small and midsize
businesses especially would face devastating challenges
throughout the pandemic. One of the most pressing
needs was maintaining their access to capital, so we
made $180 million in low-interest loans and Google.org
grants available to small businesses in the United States
through the Grow with Google Small Business Fund and
our partnership with Opportunity Finance Network.
We also established a $200 million investment fund to
support small businesses outside of the United States.
To help small businesses stay connected to their

customers, we updated our free Business Profiles on
Search and Maps, making it possible for businesses
to share if they’re offering things like dine-in, in-store
shopping, no-contact delivery, or curbside pickup.
Today, people can find this information in Search and
Maps for more than 2 million restaurants and retailers in
the United States. We used Google’s Duplex technology
to make calls to businesses and confirm information like
updated hours and temporary closures, enabling us to
make 3 million updates to business information globally,
which have been seen by people over 20 billion times in
Search and Maps. One in three small business owners
in the United States said that without digital tools, they
would have had to close all or part of their business,1
and 59% said that Google tools helped them survive
throughout the pandemic.2

Just as technology has been a lifeline to help
many small businesses during the COVID-19 crisis,
online tools helped people get new skills and find good-
paying jobs. We launched Grow with Google OnAir in
May, making free digital skills training available online
to everyone in the United States and Canada for the
first time. And because you shouldn’t need a college
diploma to have economic security, we announced new
Google Career Certificates, online programs designed to
prepare people for jobs in high-growth fields like project
management and data analytics. Google is hiring these
certificate graduates, and more than 130 employers
have joined our employer consortium, eager to hire
people who have earned these certificates.

and we will increase the
number of Black+ Googlers
at all other levels by at least

18

Year in Review

The racial injustices of 2020 forced the world to reckon
with the long-standing inequities that hold too many
people back from realizing their full potential. Tackling
these issues requires a systems-level approach, one
that starts with building for a sense of belonging in our
workplace and extends into the world.

As part of our concrete commitments to build
sustainable equity for underrepresented communities —
especially Black+ Googlers and users — we’re improving
our hiring and making Google a place where they
can stay and thrive. By 2025, we plan to improve
representation of underrepresented groups at senior
levels by 30% and will more than double the number
of Black+ Googlers at all other levels. Our commitment
to equity also extends to the thousands of suppliers
who help us run our business — we are committed to
spending a minimum of $1 billion with diverse-owned
suppliers in the United States every year starting in 2021.
Building products that are truly helpful for everyone

means co-creating with underrepresented voices
throughout the product development process. From a
new feature in Search and Maps that helps people
identify and support Black-owned businesses to the new
TalkBack braille keyboard for people who are blind or
have low vision, our products are designed to be helpful
in the moments that matter to underrepresented groups.
Our work here is never done; through research initiatives
like Project Euphonia, an AI-powered effort that is aiming
to make speech recognition more accessible to people
with atypical speech, we’re committed to making sure
everyone is included and understood.

Beyond our walls, we focused on investing in

programs that create economic opportunity, improve
access to education, and support racial justice
organizations. In 2020, we announced a $175 million
economic opportunity package to support Black
business owners, founders, job seekers, and developers,
and committed $3 million to close racial equity gaps in
CS education and increase Black representation in STEM.
Building on $32 million in donations toward criminal
justice reform over the past five years, Google.org also
committed an additional $12 million in grants to advance
racial justice and provided pro bono technical support,
embedding Google employees at the Center for Policing
Equity and Morehouse School of Medicine.

As we look to the future, we are committed to
continuing to listen, learn, and take action to accelerate
our progress toward a workplace and world where
everyone can belong.

safeguard our planet

1B

By 2022, we will offer
1 billion people new ways
to live more sustainably
via our core products.

We’ve been carbon
neutral since

2007

20

Year in Review

The science is clear: The world must act now if we’re
going to avert the worst consequences of climate
change. We are committed to doing our part. Google was
the first major company to become carbon neutral, in
2007, and the first major company to match our energy
use with 100% renewable energy, in 2017. In 2020,
we neutralized our legacy carbon footprint since our
founding, making Google the first major company to be
carbon neutral for its entire operating history.

We are proud to operate the cleanest cloud in
the industry — Google Cloud is the only major cloud
provider to purchase enough renewable energy to cover
our entire operations, and Google is the largest annual
corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world.
But we plan to go even further — by 2030, we aim to
become the first major company to operate on carbon-
free energy 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a
year. This means every email sent through Gmail, every
question asked to Google Search, and every YouTube
video watched will be powered by data centers that are
supplied by clean energy every hour of every day.

In 2020, we issued $5.75 billion in sustainability

bonds, the largest sustainability or green bond issuance
by any company in history. The proceeds from these
sustainability bonds will fund ongoing and new projects
that are environmentally or socially responsible and
enable investors to join us in tackling critical issues.
Beyond our operational commitments, we’re
thinking about how we can help everyone reduce their
environmental impact. Cities account for 70% of the
world’s carbon emissions. That’s why we created the
Environmental Insights Explorer, a tool that helps cities
track and reduce their carbon emissions and maximize
their renewable energy use. We’re committed to helping
over 500 cities and local governments reduce an
aggregate of 1 gigaton of carbon emissions annually
by 2030.

We know that people are increasingly looking
for ways to minimize their environmental impact in
their daily lives, including finding less carbon-intensive
ways to travel. By 2022, we’ll find new ways that our
core products can help 1 billion people make more
sustainable choices.

We’re optimistic that by harnessing new
technologies and empowering others, this can be the
most decisive decade for climate action yet. We’re
proud to do our part and to help move the world closer
to a carbon-free future for all.

z PART I

— ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Overview
As our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders’ letter, “Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to
become one.” That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring us to tackle big problems, and
invest in moonshots like artificial intelligence (“AI”) research and quantum computing. We continue this work under the leadership
of Sundar Pichai, who has served as CEO of Google since 2015 and as CEO of Alphabet since 2019.

Alphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google — which we report as two segments: Google Services and
Google Cloud. We report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Our Other Bets include earlier stage technologies that
are further afield from our core Google business. We take a long term view and manage the portfolio of Other Bets with the discipline
and rigor needed to deliver long-term returns. Our Alphabet structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong
leaders and independence.

Access and technology for everyone

The Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers, capable of propelling new ideas and people forward. Our mission to
organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was when we were founded
in 1998. Since then, we’ve evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that helps you get things done.
We’re focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools they need to increase
their knowledge, health, happiness and success.

Across Alphabet, we’re focused on continually innovating in areas where technology can have an impact on people’s lives. Every year,
there are trillions of searches on Google, and we continue to invest deeply in AI and other technologies to ensure the most helpful
Search experience possible. People come to YouTube for entertainment, information and opportunities to learn something new. And
Google Assistant offers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices, providing intelligent help throughout
your day, no matter where you are.

Since the pandemic began, our teams have built new features to help users go about their daily lives, and to support businesses
working to serve their customers during an uncertain time. In conjunction with Apple, we launched Exposure Notification apps that
are being used by local governments globally. Our COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports are used by public health agencies and
researchers around the globe, and we’ve committed hundreds of millions of dollars to help small businesses through a combination
of small business loans, grants and ad credits. Importantly, we’ve made authoritative content a key focus area across both Google
Search and YouTube to help users search for trusted public health information.

Our Other Bets are also pursuing initiatives with similar goals. For instance, as a part of our efforts in the Metro Phoenix area, Waymo
is working toward our goal of making transportation safer and easier for everyone while Verily is developing tools and platforms to
improve health outcomes.

Moonshots

Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads
to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were
crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, but those efforts have matured into major platforms
for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. We continue to look toward the future and continue to invest for
the long-term. As we said in the original founders’ letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in
because they are the key to our long-term success.

The power of machine learning

Across the company, machine learning and AI are increasingly driving many of our latest innovations. Our investments in machine
learning over the past decade have enabled us to build products that are smarter and more helpful. For example, a huge breakthrough
in natural language understanding, called BERT, now improves results for almost every English language search query.

ALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT

ITEM 1  BUSINESS

DeepMind made a significant AI-powered breakthrough, solving a 50-year-old protein folding challenge, which will help us better
understand one of life’s fundamental building blocks, and will enable researchers to tackle new and difficult problems, from fighting
diseases to environmental sustainability.

Google
For reporting purposes, Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.

Google Services

SERVING OUR USERS

We have always been a company committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people. Our
product innovations have made our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Google Services’
core products and platforms include Android, Chrome, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and
YouTube, each with broad and growing adoption by users around the world.

Our products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than two decades ago. Rather than the ten
blue links in our early search results, users can now get direct answers to their questions using their computer, mobile device, or
their own voice, making it quicker, easier and more natural to find what you’re looking for.

This drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and creation of digital
content, on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. With the migration to mobile, people are consuming more
digital content by watching more videos, playing more games, listening to more music, reading more books, and using more apps
than ever before. Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to find
great digital content.

Fueling all of these great digital experiences are powerful platforms and hardware. That’s why we continue to invest in platforms like
our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, Chrome operating system, as well as growing our family of great hardware
devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful, make your life easier, and get better over time, by combining the best
of our AI, software, and hardware. This is reflected in our latest generation of hardware products like Pixel 4a, Pixel 4a 5G and
Pixel 5 phones, Chromecast with Google TV and the Google Nest Hub smart display. Creating beautiful products that people rely on
every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long run.

Key to building helpful products for users is our commitment to privacy, security and user choice. As the Internet evolves, we continue
to invest in keeping data safe, including enhanced malware features in Chrome and improvements to auto-delete controls that will
automatically delete web and app searches after 18 months.

HOW WE MAKE MONEY

Our advertising products deliver relevant ads at just the right time, to give people useful commercial information, regardless of the
device they’re using. We also provide advertisers with tools that help them better attribute and measure their advertising campaigns.
Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses, and we offer a wide range of products across devices
and formats. Google Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance advertising and brand advertising.

z Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on, leading to direct engagement with advertisers.
Most of our performance advertisers pay us when a user engages in their ads. Performance advertising lets our advertisers
connect with users while driving measurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads
that appear on Google Search & other properties, YouTube and the properties of Google Network Members. In addition, Google
Network Members use our platforms to display relevant ads on their properties, generating revenues when site visitors view or
click on the ads. We continue to invest in our advertising programs and make significant upgrades.

z Brand advertising helps enhance users’ awareness of and affinity with advertisers’ products and services, through videos, text,
images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types
of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns.

We have built a world-class ad technology platform for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital marketing
businesses. We aim to ensure great user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships
with brands and agencies. We also seek to improve the measurability of advertising so advertisers know when their campaigns are
effective.

ITEM 1  BUSINESS

We have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating
the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, ranging from filtering out invalid traffic, removing billions
of bad ads from our systems every year to closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them
when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.

We continue to look to the future and are making long-term investments that will grow revenues beyond advertising, including Google
Play, hardware, and YouTube. We are also investing in research efforts in AI and quantum computing to foster innovation across our
businesses and create new opportunities.

Google Cloud

Google was a company built in the cloud. We continue to invest in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI. We
see significant opportunity in helping businesses utilize these strengths with features like data migration, modern development
environments and machine learning tools to provide enterprise-ready cloud services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google
Workspace (formerly known as G Suite). Google Cloud Platform enables developers to build, test, and deploy applications on its
highly scalable and reliable infrastructure. Our Google Workspace collaboration tools — which include apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive,
Calendar, Meet and more — are designed with real-time collaboration and machine intelligence to help people work smarter. Because
more and more of today’s great digital experiences are being built in the cloud, our Google Cloud products help businesses of all
sizes take advantage of the latest technology advances to operate more efficiently.

Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services and Google Workspace collaboration
tools.

Other Bets
Throughout Alphabet, we are also using technology to try and solve big problems across many industries. Alphabet’s investment in
our portfolio of Other Bets include emerging businesses at various stages of development, ranging from those in the research and
development phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving,
successful businesses in the medium to long term. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty,
some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues are primarily generated
from internet and TV services, as well as licensing and R&D services.

Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside
investors. We are investing in our portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments.

Competition
Our business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable competition in every
aspect of our business, particularly from companies that seek to connect people with online information and provide them with
relevant advertising. We face competition from:

z General purpose search engines and information services, such as Baidu, Microsoft’s Bing, Naver, Seznam, Verizon’s Yahoo, and

Yandex.

z Vertical search engines and e-commerce websites, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking’s Kayak (travel queries),
Microsoft’s LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and
apps rather than go through Google.

z Social networks, such as Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service

referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.

z Other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television. Our advertisers typically advertise in

multiple media, both online and offline.

z Other online advertising platforms and networks, including Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Facebook, that compete for advertisers

that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.

z Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&T, Disney, Facebook, Hulu, Netflix and TikTok.

ALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT

PART I
ITEM 1  BUSINESS

In businesses that are further afield from our advertising business, we compete with companies that have longer operating histories
and more established relationships with customers and users. We face competition from:

z Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.

z Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed

proprietary platforms.

z Providers of enterprise cloud services, including Alibaba, Amazon, and Microsoft.

z Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.

Competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to deliver and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace
across our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:

z Users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising,

as well as the general usefulness, security and availability of our products and services.

z Advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements

in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels.

z Content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from

advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.

Ongoing Commitment to Sustainability
At Google, we build technology that helps people do more for the planet. We strive to build sustainability into everything we do,
including designing and operating efficient data centers, advancing carbon-free energy, creating sustainable workplaces, building
better devices and services, empowering users with technology, and enabling a responsible supply chain.

Google has been carbon neutral since 2007, and in 2019, for the third consecutive year, we matched 100% of our electricity consumption
with renewable energy purchases. We are the largest annual corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world, based on renewable
electricity purchased in megawatt-hour (MWh). In 2020, we neutralized our entire legacy carbon footprint since our founding (covering
all our operational emissions before we became carbon neutral in 2007), making Google the first major company to achieve carbon
neutrality for its entire operating history. In our third decade of climate action, we’ve set our most ambitious goal yet: to run our
business on carbon-free energy everywhere, at all times, by 2030.

We’re also investing in technologies to help our partners and people all over the world make sustainable choices. For example, we
intend to enable 5 GW of new carbon-free energy across our key manufacturing regions by 2030 through investment. We anticipate
this will spur more than $5 billion in clean energy investments, avoid the amount of emissions equal to taking more than 1 million cars
off the road each year, and create more than 8,000 clean energy jobs. With the Environmental Insights Explorer, we’re also working to
help more than 500 cities and local governments globally reduce a total of 1 gigaton of carbon emissions annually by 2030 — that’s
the equivalent of the annual carbon emissions of a country the size of Japan.

Google’s products are already helping people make more sustainable choices in their daily lives, whether it’s using Google Maps
to find bike-shares and electric vehicle charging stations, or in many European countries, using Google Flights to sort the least
carbon-intensive option flights. There are more tools and information we can provide, and our goal is to find new ways that our
products can help 1 billion people make more sustainable choices by 2022.

Climate change is one of the most significant global challenges of our time. In 2017, we developed a climate resilience strategy,
which included conducting a climate scenario analysis. We’ve earned a spot on the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project)
Climate Change A List for seven consecutive years. We believe our CDP climate change response reflects the recommendations of
the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

In 2020, we issued $5.75 billion in sustainability bonds, the largest sustainability or green bond issuance by any company in history.
The net proceeds from the issuance are used to fund environmentally and socially responsible projects in the following eight areas:
energy efficiency, clean energy, green buildings, clean transportation, circular economy and design, affordable housing, commitment
to racial equity, and support for small businesses and COVID-19 crisis response.

More information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports, including Google’s environmental
report. The content of our sustainability reports are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any
other report or document we file with the SEC.

Culture and Workforce
We’re a company of curious, talented and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and encourage the iteration
of ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society.

Our people are critical for our continued success. We work hard to provide an environment where Googlers can have fulfilling careers,
and be happy, healthy and productive. We offer industry-leading benefits and programs to take care of the diverse needs of our
employees and their families, including access to excellent healthcare choices, opportunities for career growth and development,
and resources to support their financial health. Our competitive compensation programs help us to attract and retain top candidates,
and we will continue to invest in recruiting talented people to technical and non-technical roles and rewarding them well.

Alphabet is committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and we’re committed to growing a workforce
that’s representative of the users we serve. More information on Google’s approach to diversity can be found in our annual diversity
reports, available publicly at diversity.google. The content of our diversity reports is not incorporated by reference into this Annual
Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.

We have work councils and statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries and we are committed to supporting
protected labor rights, maintaining an open culture and listening to all Googlers. Supporting healthy and open dialogue is central
to how we work, and we communicate information about the company through multiple internal channels to our employees. As of
December 31, 2020, Alphabet had 135,301 employees.

When necessary, we contract with businesses around the world to provide specialized services where we don’t have appropriate
in-house expertise or resources, often in fields that require specialized training like cafe operations, customer support, content
moderation and physical security. We also contract with temporary staffing agencies when we need to cover short-term leaves,
when we have spikes in business needs, or when we need to quickly incubate special projects. We choose our partners and staffing
agencies carefully, and review their compliance with Google’s Supplier Code of Conduct. We continually make improvements to
promote a respectful and positive working environment for everyone — employees, vendors and temporary staff alike.

Government Regulation
We are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. Like
other companies in the technology industry, we face heightened scrutiny from both U.S. and foreign governments with respect to our
compliance with laws and regulations. Our compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could, individually or in
the aggregate, increase our cost of doing business, impact our competitive position relative to our peers, and/or otherwise have an
adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. For additional information about government
regulation applicable to our business, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, Trends in Our Business in Part II, Item 7, and Legal Matters
in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Intellectual Property
We rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology
and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain
names and copyrights. We have also filed patent applications in the U.S. and foreign countries covering certain of our technology,
and acquired patent assets to supplement our portfolio. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future,
certain of our rights to other parties.

Seasonality
Our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends such
as traditional retail seasonality (including developments and volatility arising from COVID-19).

— ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described below,
which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Risks Specific to our Company

We generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising, and reduced spending by advertisers, a loss of partners, or
new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize ads could harm our business.

We generated over 80% of total revenues from the display of ads online in 2020. Many of our advertisers, companies that distribute
our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at any time. These partners
may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new
sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising
policies and data privacy practices, as well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices may affect the
advertising that we are able to provide, which could harm our business. In addition, technologies have been developed that make
customized ads more difficult or that block the display of ads altogether and some providers of online services have integrated
technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior
value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

In addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns.
Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including COVID-19 and its effects on the global economy (as discussed in greater detail in
our COVID-19 risk factor under ‘General Risks’ below), have impacted the demand for advertising and resulted in fluctuations in the
amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, and could have an adverse impact on such demand and spend, which could harm
our financial condition and operating results.

We face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we
may not remain competitive, which could harm our business and operating results.

Our business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing technologies, shifting user
needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately anticipate technology
developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses
evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services. We must continue to invest
significant resources in research and development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and new and
existing products and services.

We have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from
large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer operating histories and well established
relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position,
including by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in research and development and in talent, aggressively initiating
intellectual property claims (whether or not meritorious), and continuing to compete aggressively for users, advertisers, customers,
and content providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively
interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our competitors may also be
able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before us.

Our operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the needs of our users, advertisers, publishers,
customers, and content providers. As technologies continue to develop, our competitors may be able to offer experiences that are, or
that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant
resources in order to remain competitive. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or
in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers, our operating results could be harmed.

ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS

Our ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt our
current operations and harm our financial condition and operating results.

We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The investments that
we are making across Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products
and services that are useful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our investments in Google Services,
Google Cloud and Other Bets span a wide range of industries beyond online advertising. Such investments ultimately may not be
commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in pursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated
liabilities. These endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of management resources and, with
respect to Other Bets, the use of alternative investment, governance, or compensation structures that may fail to adequately align
incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.

Within Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones and home devices, which is a highly
competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption of technological advancements by
competitors, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance
characteristics, and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be
able to provide hardware that competes effectively.

Within Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, including Google
Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing
services and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our salesforce. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing
and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models are competitive and evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale
and profitability to achieve our business objectives.

Within Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among others. These
investment areas face intense competition from large experienced and well-funded competitors and our offerings may not be able
to compete effectively or to operate at sufficient levels of profitability.

In addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use artificial intelligence and machine learning, raise ethical,
technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and
services. Because all of these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will
be successful and will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.

Our revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition and the continued
expansion of our business into a variety of new fields. Changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product and policy changes,
product mix, and property mix and an increasing competition for advertising may also affect our advertising revenue growth rate.
We may also experience a decline in our revenue growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, if there is a decrease in the
rate of adoption of our products, services, and technologies, or due to deceleration or decline in demand for devices used to access
our services, among other factors. In addition, COVID-19 and its effects on the global economy has impacted and may continue to
adversely impact our revenue growth rate (as discussed in greater detail in our COVID-19 risk factor under ‘General Risks’ below).

In addition to a decline in our revenue growth rate, we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting
from a variety of factors, such as the continued expansion of our business into new fields, including products and services such as
hardware, Google Cloud, and subscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins
lower than those we generate from advertising. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing
regulations, increasing competition and increased costs for many aspects of our business, including within advertising where changes
such as device mix, property mix, and partner agreements can affect margin. The margin we earn on revenues generated from our
Google Network Members could also decrease in the future if we pay a larger percentage of advertising fees to them. We may also
pay increased TAC to our distribution partners as well as increased content acquisition costs to content providers. We may also face
an increase in infrastructure costs, supporting businesses such as Search, Google Cloud, and YouTube. Many of our expenses are
less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenues.

Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may
not be indicative of our future performance.

ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS

Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services
and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.

Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events
outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services, and technologies. For
example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are
distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be
sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect
some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later
turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will
be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.

We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitive
information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.
We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word “Google” could become so commonly
used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” Some courts have ruled that “Google” is a protectable trademark, but it is
possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the United States, may reach a different determination. If this happens, we
could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products,
thus diminishing our brand.

Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting
our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could
make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.

Our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our
base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.

Our strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google
Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products that better
serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. Our brands may be negatively affected
by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and
security issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to appropriately respond to
the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable practices by advertisers,
or to otherwise adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands.

Furthermore, failure to maintain and enhance equity in our brands may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality, innovative products
and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of settings.

We face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could harm our financial condition,
operating results, and prospects.

We face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability to supply both our
products and our internet-based services.

We rely on other companies to manufacture many of our finished products, to design certain of our components and parts, and
to participate in the distribution of our products and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to
engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their
obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms
of our arrangements with them.

We have experienced and/or may experience supply shortages and price increases driven by raw material, component or part
availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, natural disasters or
pandemics (including COVID-19), the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and increased
storm severity), and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers. We have experienced and/or may in
the future, experience shortages or other supply chain disruptions that could negatively affect our operations. In addition, some of
the components we use in our technical infrastructure and products are available from only one or limited sources, and we may not
be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. In addition, a significant supply
interruption could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay product availability.

ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS

We may enter into long term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and conditions. We may be liable
for materials and products that are not consumed due to market acceptance, technological change, obsolescences, quality, product
recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of our hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum
purchase requirements, if the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased
materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture
and negatively affect our financial results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms
based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply.

Our products and services may have quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, or operations. Sometimes, these issues may
be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not
meet expectations or our products or services are defective, it could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

We require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies, such as the Google
Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance and intellectual
property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. Violations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply
chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license
rights to intellectual property, could affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims.

Interruption, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications systems could hurt our
ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating
results. In addition, complications with the design or implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system
could harm our business and operations.

The availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation of our
information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage, interference, or interruption from
modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, natural disasters or pandemics (including COVID-19), the effects of climate change
(such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and increased storm severity), power loss, telecommunications failures, computer
viruses, ransomware attacks, computer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems.
Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are
also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions resulting from
problems experienced by facility operators. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot
account for all eventualities.

The occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic (including COVID-19), closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems at,
or impacting, our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly
technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities, which could result in interruptions in or failure of our services
or systems.

In addition, we rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results.
We are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new ERP system, which will replace much of our existing core financial
systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve
data management, and provide timely information to our management team. We may not be able to successfully implement the
ERP system without experiencing delays, increased costs, and other difficulties. Failure to successfully design and implement the new
ERP system as planned could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Additionally, if we do not effectively
implement the ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting could be negatively affected.

Our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, our financial condition, and
operating results.

Our international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow internationally. International
revenues accounted for approximately 53% of our consolidated revenues in 2020. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this
section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following:

z Restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating

cash earned in countries outside the U.S.

z Import and export requirements, tariffs and other market access barriers that may prevent or impede us from offering products or
providing services to a particular market, or that could limit our ability to source assemblies and finished products from a particular
market, and may increase our operating costs.

z Longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud.

ALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT

PART I
ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS

z Evolving foreign events, including the effect of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, may adversely affect our
revenues and could subject us to new regulatory costs and challenges (including the transfer of personal data between the EU and
the United Kingdom and new customer requirements), in addition to other adverse effects that we are unable to effectively anticipate.

z Anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain payments to government

officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties.

z Uncertainty regarding liability for services and content, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent.

z Different employee/employer relationships, existence of works councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance,

language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions.

Because we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure
to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant
fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings,
particularly in light of market volatilities due to COVID-19. Hedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional
risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results.

Risks Related to our Industry

People access the Internet through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the advancement of
technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our products and services
developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed.

People access the Internet through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, mobile phones, smartphones, laptops and
tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables, automobiles, and television-streaming devices. Our products and
services may be less popular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its
devices, and our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited functionality for our users or our
advertisers on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices. In addition,
search queries are increasingly being undertaken via voice-activated speakers, apps, social media or other platforms, which could
harm our business. It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing
competitive new products and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and supporting products
and services across multiple platforms and devices. Failing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers,
suppliers, distributors, developers, and users, or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and
platforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities.

Data privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could damage our reputation, cause us to
incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. Software
bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks on our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data
and interference with our users and customers’ ability to use our products and services, harming our business operations and
reputation.

Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other data-privacy-
related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices
may change over time as expectations regarding privacy and data change.

Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive information, and bugs, theft,
misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information,
improper use and disclosure of such information, litigation, and other potential liability. Systems and control failures, security breaches,
failure to comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in government and legal exposure,
seriously harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business, and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers.
We expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that shield against bugs, theft, misuse, or
security vulnerabilities or breaches.

We experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. We may experience
future security issues, whether due to employee error or malfeasance or system errors or vulnerabilities in our or other parties’
systems, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure. Government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and
adverse press coverage could harm our business. We may be unable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement
adequate preventative measures. Attacks and security issues could also compromise trade secrets and other sensitive information,
harming our business.

While we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including dedicated worldwide
incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or pandemic (including COVID-19), may
not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not respond quickly enough, or may fail to sufficiently
remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal, reputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business,
financial condition, and operating results.

Our ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of our platforms and misuse
of user data.

In addition to our efforts to mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety, security, and content review
efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties, including investigations and review
of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services. As a result of these efforts, we could discover
incidents of unnecessary access to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. We may not discover all such
incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data limitations, including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale
of activity on our platform, or other factors, including factors outside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic (including
COVID-19), and we may be notified of such incidents or activity via third parties. Such incidents and activities may include the use
of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user
accounts, election interference, improper ad purchases, activities that threaten people’s safety on- or offline, or instances of spamming,
scraping, or spreading disinformation. We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate
any such incidents. Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and
brands, require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adversely affect our business and
financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result in
monetary penalties and damages, divert management’s time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.

Problematic content on our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content farms, and other
violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could damage our reputation and deter our current
and potential users from using our products and services.

We, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms, including sophisticated attempts by
bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate revenues, or to otherwise generate traffic that
does not represent genuine user interest or intent. While we invest significantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant results
and to detect and prevent low-quality content and invalid traffic, we may be unable to adequately detect and prevent such abuses or
promote high-quality content, particularly during times of a natural disaster or pandemic (including COVID-19).

Many websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than
our search engine’s assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts (known as “web spam”) may affect the
quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading or undesirable content.

Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we
expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their rankings. We continuously combat web spam in our
search results, including through indexing technology that makes it harder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. We
also continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam from abusing our platforms.

We also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including content farms, which are websites that
generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic
changes focused on detecting and preventing abuse from low-quality websites.

We also face other challenges on our platforms, including violations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted
election interference, activities that threaten the safety and/or well-being of our users on- or offline, and the spreading of disinformation,
among other challenges.

If we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality content, it could hurt our
reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our financial condition or operating results. It
may also subject us to litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management’s
time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.

Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may
be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional
expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.

Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant
bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband
and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies,

ALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT

and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take measures that
could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their
infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by
providing our competitors preferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination
by internet access providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the United States and elsewhere regarding such protections.
For example, in 2018 the United States Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could permit
internet access providers to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services. In addition, in
some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or blockages. COVID-19 has
also resulted in quarantines, shelter in place orders, and work from home directives, all of which have increased demands for internet
access and may create access challenges. These could result in a loss of existing users, customers and advertisers, goodwill, and
increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new users, customers and advertisers, thereby harming our business.

Risks Related to Laws and Regulations

We face increased regulatory scrutiny as well as changes in regulatory conditions, laws and policies governing a wide range of
topics that may negatively affect our business.

We and other companies in the technology industry face increased regulatory scrutiny, enforcement action, and other proceedings.
For instance, the U.S. Department of Justice, joined by a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint against
Google on October 20, 2020, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. Separately,
on December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against Google in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating
to its advertising technology. Various other regulatory agencies in the United States and around the world, including competition
enforcers, consumer protection agencies, data protection authorities, grand juries, inter-agency consultative groups, and a range of
other governmental bodies have and continue to review our products and services and their compliance with laws and regulations
around the world. We continue to cooperate with these investigations. Various laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits,
and regulatory actions have in the past and may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing auditing
and monitoring obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral
litigation, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Changes in international and local social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide
range of topics may increase our cost of doing business, limit our ability to pursue certain business models, offer products or services
in certain jurisdictions, or cause us to change our business practices. We have in the past had to alter or withdraw certain products
and services as a result of laws or regulations that made them unfeasible, and new laws or regulations, such as the News Media
Bargaining Code drafted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission currently tabled in parliament, could result in our
having to alter or withdraw products and services in the future. These additional costs of doing business, new limitations or changes
to our business model or practices could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

A variety of new and existing laws and/or interpretations could harm our business.

We are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. New laws and regulations
(or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner inconsistent with our practices) may make our
products and services less useful, limit our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and services, require
us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices. These laws and
regulations are evolving and involve matters central to our business, including, among others:

z New competition laws and related regulations around the world, that can limit certain business practices, and in some cases,

create the risk of significant penalties.

z Privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 that came into effect in January of 2020 and the California
Privacy Rights Act which will go into effect in 2023, both of which give new data privacy rights to California residents, and SB-327
in California, which regulates the security of data in connection with internet connected devices.

z Data protection laws passed by many states within the U.S. and by certain countries regarding notification to data subjects and/

or regulators when there is a security breach of personal data.

z New laws further restricting the collection, processing and/or sharing of advertising-related data.

z Copyright or similar laws around the world, including the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (EUCD) of
April 17, 2019, which EU Member States must implement by June 7, 2021; and the News Media Bargaining Code drafted by the
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. These and similar laws that have been adopted or proposed introduce new
constraining licensing regimes that could affect our ability to operate. The EUCD and similar laws could increase the liability of some
content-sharing services with respect to content uploaded by their users. Some of these laws, as well as follow-on administrative

or judicial actions, have also created or may create a new property right in news publications that limits the ability of some online
services to interact with or present such content. They may also impose compensation negotiations with news agencies and
publishers for the use of such content, which may result in payment obligations that significantly exceed the value that such
content provides to Google and its users.

z Data localization laws, which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored and/or

processed within that country.

z Various U.S. and international laws that govern the distribution of certain materials to children and regulate the ability of online

services to collect information from minors.

z Various laws with regard to content removal and disclosure obligations, such as the Network Enforcement Act in Germany, which
may affect our businesses and operations and may subject us to significant fines if such laws are interpreted and applied in a
manner inconsistent with our practices or when we may not proactively discover such content due to the scale of third-party
content and the limitations of existing technologies. Other countries, including Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom, have
implemented or are considering similar legislation imposing penalties for failure to remove certain types of content.

z Various legislative, litigation, and regulatory activity regarding our Google Play billing policies and business model, which could

result in monetary penalties, damages and/or prohibition.

In addition, the applicability and scope of these laws, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain and could harm our business.
For example:

z We rely on statutory safe harbors, as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the Communications
Decency Act in the United States and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, against liability for various linking, caching, and hosting
activities. Any legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us. There are legislative proposals in
both the US and EU that could reduce our safe harbor protection.

z Court decisions such as the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on May 13, 2014 on the ‘right to be
forgotten,’ which allows individuals to demand that Google remove search results about them in certain instances, may limit the
content we can show to our users and impose significant operational burdens.

The introduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies, our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions we
take may subject us to additional laws and regulations. Our investment in a variety of new fields, such as healthcare and payment
services, may expand the scope of regulations that apply to our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations
are high and are likely to increase in the future. Any failure on our part to comply with laws and regulations can result in negative
publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.

We are subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings that may harm our business, financial
condition, and operating results.

We are subject to claims, suits, and government investigations involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security,
consumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered
by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Due to our manufacturing and sale of an expanded suite of
products, including hardware as well as Google Cloud offerings, we also are subject to a variety of claims including product warranty,
product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation. We may also be subject to claims
involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental impacts, or service disruptions or failures.

Any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources,
negative publicity and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires
significant judgment. The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, additional
substantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

We may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content.

Our products and services let users exchange information, advertise products and services, conduct business, and engage in various
online activities. We also place advertisements displayed on other companies’ websites, and we offer third-party products, services,
and/or content. The law relating to the liability of online service providers for others’ activities on their services is still somewhat
unsettled around the world. Claims have been brought against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright and
trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, torts, fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature and content of
information available on or via our services.

We may be subject to claims by virtue of our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to content
created by third parties. Defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management
and other resources, may result in monetary liabilities or penalties, and may require us to change our business in an adverse manner.

Privacy and data protection regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Adverse interpretations of these laws could
harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Authorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data
protection and limits on encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation could result in fines and orders
requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to provide services, harming our
business operations. Complying with these evolving laws could result in substantial costs and harm the quality of our products and
services, negatively affecting our business, and may be particularly challenging during certain times, such as a natural disaster or
pandemic (including COVID-19).

Recent legal developments in Europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from Europe to
the United States. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to all of our activities conducted from an
establishment in the EU or related to products and services that we offer to EU users or customers, or the monitoring of their behavior
in the EU. The GDPR creates a range of new compliance obligations.

Ensuring compliance with the GDPR is an ongoing commitment that involves substantial costs, and despite our efforts, governmental
authorities or others have asserted and may continue to assert that our business practices fail to comply with its requirements.
If our operations are found to violate GDPR requirements, we may incur substantial fines, have to change our business practices,
and face reputational harm, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. In particular, serious breaches of the GDPR
can result in administrative fines of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenues. Fines of up to 2% of annual worldwide revenues can
be levied for other specified violations.

The EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks allow U.S. companies that self-certify to the U.S. Department of Commerce
and publicly commit to comply with specified requirements to import personal data from the EU and Switzerland. Recently, the CJEU
ruled that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield is an invalid transfer mechanism, but upheld Standard Contractual Clauses as a valid transfer
mechanism, provided they meet certain requirements. The validity of data transfer mechanisms remains subject to legal, regulatory,
and political developments in both Europe and the U.S., such as recent recommendations from the European Data Protection Board,
the invalidation of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and potential invalidation of other data transfer mechanisms, which could have a
significant adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the EEA.

These developments create some uncertainty, and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or harm the operations of
our products and services in ways that harm our business.

We face, and may continue to face intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend, result in significant
damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.

We, like other internet, technology and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or
other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent-holding companies may frequently seek to generate income from
patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us. As we have grown, the number of intellectual property claims against us
has increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products, services, and technologies.

We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our
products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Other parties have also sought broad injunctive
relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion
and cease-and-desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell our products or services in the U.S. or elsewhere if our products or
services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims. Adverse results
in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are available
at all), or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. They may also cause us to change
our business practices and require development of non-infringing products, services, or technologies, which could result in a loss of
revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.

Many of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend against certain intellectual
property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them,
which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such
claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of
injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business. Moreover, intellectual property
indemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers
arising from intellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in
the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual property claims.

Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. To the extent such
claims are successful, they may harm our business, including our product and service offerings, financial condition, or operating results.

Risks Related to Ownership of our Stock

We cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value,
and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves.

We engage in share repurchases of our Class C capital stock from time to time in accordance with authorizations from the Board of
Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any
specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. Further, our share repurchases could affect our share trading
prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a
decrease in the trading prices of our stock.

The concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.

Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A common stock has one vote per share, and our Class C capital stock
has no voting rights. As of December 31, 2020, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 85.3% of our outstanding
Class B common stock, which represented approximately 51.5% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Through their
stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election
of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable
future. In addition, because our Class C capital stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the
Class C capital stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could
continue Larry and Sergey’s current relative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome
of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’
ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could
reduce the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock.

Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider
favorable.

Provisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or
changes in our management. These provisions include the following:

z Our certificate of incorporation provides for a tri-class capital stock structure. As a result of this structure, Larry and Sergey have
significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate
transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others
from initiating any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial.
As noted above, the issuance of the Class C capital stock could have the effect of continuing the influence of Larry and Sergey.

z Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the
resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors.

z Our stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would

not be able to take certain actions without holding a stockholders’ meeting.

z Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority stockholders

to elect director candidates.

z Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to propose matters
that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting
a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.

z Our Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock. The ability to issue
undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or
preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.

As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may
not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the
stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the transaction. Our Board of Directors could rely
on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.

ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS

General Risks

The continuing impacts of COVID-19 are highly unpredictable and could be significant, and may have an adverse effect on our
business, operations and our future financial performance.

Since COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, governments and municipalities around the
world have instituted measures in an effort to control the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, school
closings, travel restrictions, and closure of non-essential businesses. The macroeconomic impacts on our business continue to
evolve and be unpredictable and may continue to adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance. As a result of
the scale of the ongoing pandemic and the speed at which the global community has been impacted, our revenue growth rate and
expense as a percentage of our revenues in future periods may differ significantly from our historical rate, and our future operating
results may fall below expectations.

The future impacts of the ongoing pandemic on our business, operations and future financial performance could include, but are
not limited to:

z Significant decline in advertising revenues as advertiser spending slows due to an economic downturn. This decline in advertising
revenues could persist through and beyond a recessionary period. In addition, we may experience a significant and prolonged shift
in user behavior such as a shift in interests to less commercial topics.

z Significant decline in other revenues due to a decline or shifts in customer demand. For example, if consumer demand for electronics

significantly declines, our hardware revenues could be significantly impacted.

z Adverse impacts to our operating income, operating margin, net income, EPS and respective growth rates – particularly if expenses
do not decrease across Alphabet at the same pace as revenue declines. Many of our expenses are less variable in nature and/
or may not correlate to changes in revenues, including costs associated with our data centers and facilities as well as employee
compensation. As such, we may not be able to decrease them significantly in the short-term, or we may choose not to significantly
reduce them in an effort to remain focused on long-term outlook and investment opportunities.

z Significant decline in our operating cash flows as a result of decreased advertiser spending and deterioration in the credit quality
and liquidity of our customers, which could adversely affect our accounts receivable. Investing cash flows could decrease due
to slowing spend on data center and facilities construction projects due to a slowing or stopping of construction or significant
restrictions placed on construction.

z The prolonged and broad-based shift to a remote working environment continues to create inherent productivity, connectivity,
and oversight challenges and could affect our ability to enhance, develop and support existing products and services, detect and
prevent spam and problematic content, hold product sales and marketing events, and generate new sales leads, among others.
In addition, the changed environment under which we are operating could have an effect on our internal controls over financial
reporting as well as our ability to meet a number of our compliance requirements in a timely or quality manner. Additional and/
or extended, governmental lockdowns, restrictions or new regulations could significantly impact the ability of our employees and
vendors to work productively. Governmental restrictions have been globally inconsistent and it remains unclear when a return to
worksite locations or travel will be permitted or what restrictions will be in place in those environments. As we prepare to return
our workforce in more locations back to the office in 2021, we may experience increased costs as we prepare our facilities for a
safe return to work environment and experiment with hybrid work models, in addition to potential effects on our ability to compete
effectively and maintain our corporate culture.

Our operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of
expectations.

Our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control.

As a result, comparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis
may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our operating results
in future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed
under this Item 1A in addition to the following factors may affect our operating results:

z Our ability to attract user and/or customer adoption of, and generate significant revenues from, new products, services, and

technologies in which we have invested considerable time and resources.

z Our ability to monetize traffic on Google Search & other properties, YouTube and our Google Network Members’ properties across

various devices.

16

ALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT

PART I
ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS

z The amount and timing of operating costs and expenses and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of

our businesses, operations, and infrastructure.

z Our focus on long-term goals over short-term results.

z The results of our acquisitions, divestitures, and our investments in risky projects, including new businesses, products, services,

and technologies.

z Our ability to keep our products and services operational at a reasonable cost and without service interruptions.

z The seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising spending, and underlying business trends such as traditional retail
seasonality. Our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our growth rate has slowed,
the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate.

z Geopolitical events, including trade disputes.

z Changes in global business or macroeconomic conditions.

Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences
that may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital,
and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter
into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic transactions, which could create unforeseen operating difficulties
and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include:

z Diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic

transactions.

z Failure to successfully integrate and further develop the acquired business or technology.

z Implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company.

z Integration of the acquired company’s accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of product,

engineering, and sales and marketing functions.

z Transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms.

z Failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon approval
that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the
expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction.

z In the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the

particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.

z Cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of

employees from the businesses we acquire.

z Liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, data

privacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities.

z Litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers,

former stockholders, or other third parties.

Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic
transactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.

Our acquisitions and other strategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of
debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring
charges, any of which could harm our financial condition or operating results. Also, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions
and other strategic transactions may not materialize. In connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree,
to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, which may harm our financial condition or operating results.

If we were to lose the services of key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.

Our future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. For instance,
Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of Alphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of
our technology, maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will
employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business.

PART I
ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS

We rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or
maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.

Our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our ability to compete effectively and our
future success depends on our continuing to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our
organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted
our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in
attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes
may also impact our ability to hire, mobilize or retain some of our global talent.

In addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows and
evolves, we may need to implement more complex organizational management structures or adapt our corporate culture and work
environments to ever-changing circumstances, such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic (including COVID-19), and
these changes could impact our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse impact on our corporate culture.

We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial statements
incorporate valuation methodologies that are subjective in nature resulting in fluctuations over time.

The market value of our investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial
results of the underlying entities, foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates, including changes that may result from the
implementation of new benchmark rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors.
The effect of COVID-19 on our impairment assessment for non-marketable investments requires significant judgment due to the
uncertainty around the duration and severity of the impact.

We measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt investments, certain other instruments including stock-based compensation
awards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, at fair value
on a nonrecurring basis. The determination of fair value involves use of appropriate valuation methods and certain unobservable
inputs, require management judgment and estimation, and may change over time.

We adjust the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments to fair value for observable transactions of identical or similar
investments of the same issuer or for impairments. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized,
are recognized in other income (expense), which increases the volatility of our other income (expense). The unrealized gains and
losses we record on our non-marketable equity securities in any particular period may differ significantly from the realized gains or
losses we ultimately experience on such investments.

As a result of these factors, the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents, as well as our marketable and non-marketable securities
could decline and result in a material impairment, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.

We could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional
tax liabilities.

Our future income taxes could be negatively affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory
tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, the net gains and losses recognized by legal
entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management
program, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in
tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws), as well as certain discrete items.

In addition, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have received,
and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including in Europe, on various tax-related assertions, such as
transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative
effect on our operating results and financial condition and could require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to
our business. It may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, resulting in the diversion of management’s time
and attention. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant
judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we
believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements
and may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.

Furthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to
significant changes in ways that impair our financial results. Various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering
digital services taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes. The Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recently released proposals relating to its initiative for modernizing international
tax rules, with the goal of having different countries implement a modernized and aligned international tax framework, but there can
be no guarantee that this will occur.

ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS

In addition, in response to significant market volatility and disruptions to business operations resulting from the global spread of
COVID-19, legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may propose changes to their tax rules. These
changes could include modifications that have temporary effect, and more permanent changes. The impact of these potential new
rules on us, our long-term tax planning, and our effective tax rate could be material.

The trading price for our Class A common stock and non-voting Class C capital stock may continue to be volatile.

The trading price of our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile.

In addition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading price of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock may
fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, among others announcements by
us or our competitors of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or
capital commitments; recommendations by securities analysts or changes in their earnings estimates; announcements about our
or our competitors’ earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations, the risk of which is enhanced, in our case, because it is
our policy not to give guidance on earnings; commentary by industry and market professionals about our products, strategies, and
other matters affecting our business and results, regardless of its accuracy; the volume of shares of Class A common stock and
Class C capital stock available for public sale; sales of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock by us or by our stockholders
(including sales by our directors, executive officers, and other employees); short sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions on
shares of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock; the size, timing and share class of any share repurchase program;
and the perceived values of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock relative to one another.

In addition, the stock market in general, which can be affected by various factors, including overall economic and political conditions,
and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been
unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.

These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock,
regardless of our actual operating performance.

ITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

— ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated
financial statements and related notes included under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We have omitted discussion of 2018 results where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in Part II, Item 7 of
our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Trends in Our Business
The following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue
to affect our future results:

z Users’ behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.

The continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since inception, contributing to
revenue growth, and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business.

z Users are increasingly using diverse devices and modalities to access our products and services, and our advertising revenues

are increasingly coming from new formats.

Our users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables and smart home devices,
and want to feel connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We seek to expand our products and services to stay
in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.

We generate our advertising revenues increasingly from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats, and
the margins from the advertising revenues from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from
traditional desktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our revenues may be affected.
For example, growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors, including increased market saturation in
developed countries, which can affect our mobile advertising revenue growth rates.

We expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network Members to increase as our revenues grow and to be affected
by changes in device mix; geographic mix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid
access points; product mix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.

We expect these trends to continue to affect our revenue growth rates and put pressure on our overall margins.

z As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings which may affect our monetization.

As interactions between users and advertisers change and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand and evolve our
product offerings to serve their changing needs. Over time, we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate. For example, we have
seen an increase in YouTube ads and Google Play ads, which monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads.

z As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase

and movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues.

The shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., including in emerging
markets, such as India, where we continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising
programs useful to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased revenues from international markets over time,
as regions with emerging markets, such as APAC, have demonstrated higher revenue growth rates. We expect that our results will
continue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This
trend could impact our margins as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.

Our international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to
these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.

z The portion of our revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may affect margins.

Non-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings to our
users through products and services like Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware products, and YouTube subscriptions. Across these
initiatives, we currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and
hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud services and subscription and other services. The

24

ALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT

PART II
ITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

margins on these revenues vary significantly and may be lower than the margins on our advertising revenues. A number of our Other
Bets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such, the sources of revenues from these businesses could change
over time and the revenues could be volatile.

z As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.

We continue to make significant R&D investments in areas of strategic focus such as advertising, cloud, machine learning, and search,
as well as in new products and services. In addition, we expect to continue to invest in land and buildings for data centers and offices,
and information technology assets, which includes servers and network equipment, to support the long-term growth of our business.

In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments are an important part of our strategy and use of capital, contributing to the breadth
and depth of our offerings, expanding our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and building strong partnerships around
strategic initiatives. For example, in 2020 we announced our Google for India Digitization Fund to invest approximately $10 billion
into India over the next 5-7 years through a mix of equity investments, partnerships, and operational, infrastructure and ecosystem
investments.

z We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws and public policies, which could impact our business practices

and financial results.

Changes in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and
related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, for
example the recent antitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General as well as
the News Media Bargaining Code drafted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, our cost of doing business may
increase and our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited.

z Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.

Our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees
around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs to our employees.

The Impact of COVID-19 on our Results and Operations
In late 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 emerged and by March 11, 2020 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health
Organization. Across the United States and the world, governments and municipalities instituted measures in an effort to control the
spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, school closings, travel restrictions and the closure of non-essential
businesses. The macroeconomic impacts of COVID-19 are significant and continue to evolve, as exhibited by, among other things,
a rise in unemployment, changes in consumer behavior, and market volatility.

We began to observe the impact of COVID-19 and the related reductions in global economic activity on our financial results in March
2020 when, despite an increase in users’ search activity, our advertising revenues declined compared to the prior year due to a shift
of user search activity to less commercial topics and reduced spending by our advertisers. During the course of the quarter ended
June 30, 2020, we observed a gradual return in user search activity to more commercial topics, followed by increased spending by
our advertisers that continued throughout the second half of 2020.

We continue to assess the realized and potential credit deterioration of our customers due to changes in the macroeconomic
environment, which has been reflected in our allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable. Additionally, over the course of
the year we experienced variability in our margins as many of our expenses are less variable in nature and/or may not correlate to
changes in revenues, including costs associated with our data centers and facilities as well as employee compensation. Also, market
volatility has contributed to fluctuations in the valuation of our equity investments.

While we continued to make investments in land and buildings for data centers, offices and information technology, in 2020 we
slowed the pace of our investments, primarily as it relates to office facilities, as a result of COVID-19.

The ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business continues to evolve and be unpredictable. For example, to the extent the pandemic
disrupts economic activity globally we, like other businesses, are not immune to continued adverse impacts to our business, operations
and financial results from volatility in advertising spending, changes in user behavior and preferences, credit deterioration and liquidity
of our customers, depressed economic activity, or volatility in capital markets. The ongoing impact will depend on a number of
factors, including the duration and severity of the pandemic; the uneven impact to certain industries; advances in testing, treatment
and prevention including vaccines; and the macroeconomic impact of government measures to contain the spread of the virus and
related government stimulus measures.

To address the potential impact to our business, over the near-term, we continue to evaluate the pace of our investment plans,
including, but not limited to, our hiring, investments in data centers, servers, network equipment, real estate and facilities, marketing
and travel spending, as well as taking certain measures to support our customers, our overall workforce, and communities we
operate in. As we look to return our workforce in more locations back to the office in 2021, we may experience increased costs as

we prepare our facilities for a safe return to work environment and experiment with hybrid work models. At the same time, we believe
the current environment is accelerating digital transformation and we remain focused on innovating and investing in the services we
offer to consumers and businesses. For example, as it relates to Google Cloud, we continue to invest aggressively around the globe
in our go-to-market capabilities, product development and technical infrastructure to support long term growth. The ongoing impact
of COVID-19 and the extent of these measures we have taken and the additional measures that we may implement could have a
material impact on our financial results. Our past results may not be indicative of our future performance, and historical trends in
our financial results may differ materially.

of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

z Total revenues were $182.5 billion, an increase of 13% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in Google Services segment
revenues of $16.8 billion or 11% and an increase in Google Cloud segment revenues of $4.1 billion or 46%. Revenues from the
United States, EMEA, APAC, and Other Americas were $85.0 billion, $55.4 billion, $32.6 billion, and $9.4 billion, respectively.

z Total cost of revenues was $84.7 billion, an increase of 18% year over year. TAC was $32.8 billion, an increase of 9% year over year,
primarily driven by an increase in revenues subject to TAC. Other cost of revenues were $51.9 billion, an increase of 24% year over
year, primarily driven by an increase in data centers and other operations costs and content acquisition costs.

z Operating expenses were $56.6 billion, an increase of 5% year over year primarily driven by headcount growth and partially offset

by declines in advertising and promotional expenses and travel and entertainment expenses.

Other information:

z Operating cash flow was $65.1 billion.

z Capital expenditures, which primarily included investments in technical infrastructure, were $22.3 billion.

z Number of employees was 135,301 as of December 31, 2020. The majority of new hires during the year were engineers and

product managers.

Our Segments
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, we report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:

z Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and
YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products,
and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.

z Google Cloud includes Google’s infrastructure and data analytics platforms, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise
customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from fees received for Google Cloud Platform (“GCP”) services and Google
Workspace (formerly known as G Suite) collaboration tools.

z Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from the Other Bets are

derived primarily through the sale of internet services as well as licensing and R&D services.

Unallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and legal, including fines
and settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared research and development activities. Additionally, hedging gains
(losses) related to revenue are included in corporate costs.

GOOGLE ADVERTISING REVENUES

Our advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search & other properties and the
change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network Members’ properties and the correlation between these items,
have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors, including:

z advertiser competition for keywords;

z changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;

z changes in device mix;

z changes in foreign currency exchange rates;

z fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;

z general economic conditions including the impact of COVID-19;

z seasonality; and

z traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels.

Our advertising revenue growth rate has been affected over time as a result of a number of factors, including challenges in maintaining
our growth rate as revenues increase to higher levels; changes in our product mix; changes in advertising quality or formats and delivery;
the evolution of the online advertising market; increasing competition; our investments in new business strategies; query growth rates;
and shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues. We also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving
user preferences, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices and modalities, our
ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers, and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

Google advertising revenues consist primarily of the following:

z Google Search & other consists of revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by
search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.) and other Google owned and
operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;

z YouTube ads consists of revenues generated on YouTube properties; and

ALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT

27

PART II
ITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

z Google Network Members’ properties consist of revenues generated on Google Network Members’ properties participating in

AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.

Google Search & other
Google Search & other revenues increased $5,947 million from 2019 to 2020. The overall growth was primarily driven by interrelated
factors including increases in search queries resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices,
growth in advertiser spending primarily in the second half of the year, and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery. This
increase was partially offset by a decline in advertiser spending primarily in the first half of the year driven by the impact of COVID-19.

YouTube ads
YouTube ads revenues increased $4,623 million from 2019 to 2020. Growth was primarily driven by our direct response advertising
products, which benefited from improvements to ad formats and delivery and increased advertiser spending. Brand advertising
products also contributed to growth despite revenues being adversely impacted by a decline in advertiser spending primarily in the
first half of the year driven by the impact of COVID-19.

Google Network Members’ properties
Google Network Members’ properties revenues increased $1,543 million from 2019 to 2020. The growth was primarily driven by
strength in AdMob and Google Ad Manager.

USE OF MONETIZATION METRICS

Paid clicks for our Google Search & other properties represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users
on Google search properties and other owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play. Historically,
we included certain viewed YouTube engagement ads and the related revenues in our paid clicks and cost-per-click monetization
metrics. Over time, advertising on YouTube has expanded to multiple advertising formats and the type of viewed engagement ads
historically included in paid clicks and cost-per-click metrics have increasingly covered a smaller portion of YouTube advertising
revenues. As a result, we removed these ads and the related revenues from the paid clicks and cost-per-click metrics for the current
and historical periods presented. The revised metrics provide a better understanding of monetization trends on the properties included
within Google Search & other, as they now more closely correlate with the related changes in revenues.

Impressions for our Google Network Members’ properties include impressions displayed to users served on Google Network Members’
properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense and Google Ad Manager.

Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we
charge advertisers for each engagement by users.

Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions and
represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.

As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the
number of paid clicks on our Google Search & other properties and the number of impressions on Google Network Members’ properties
and for identifying the revenues generated by click activity on our Google Search & other properties and the revenues generated by
impression activity on Google Network Members’ properties.

Paid clicks and cost-per-click

Year Ended December 31,

(10)%

Paid clicks increased from 2019 to 2020 primarily due to an increase in clicks due to interrelated factors, resulting from ongoing
growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices; continued growth in advertiser activity; and improvements we have
made in ad formats and delivery. Growth was also driven by an increase in clicks relating to ads on Google Play. The positive effect
on our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The
decrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by reduced advertiser spending in response to COVID-19 primarily during the first half
of the year. The decrease in cost-per-click was also affected by changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product changes,
product mix, property mix, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.

Paid clicks increased from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to an increase in clicks due to interrelated factors, including an increase in

activity; and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery. Growth was also driven by an increase in clicks relating to
ads on Google Play. The positive effect on our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the

Impressions increased from 2019 to 2020 primarily due to growth in Google Ad Manager. The positive effect on our revenues from
an increase in impressions was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-impression paid by our advertisers which was driven
by a reduction in advertiser spending in response to COVID-19, primarily during the first half of the year, as well as the effect of a
combination of factors including ongoing product and policy changes and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery,
changes in device mix, geographic mix, product mix, property mix, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign
currencies.

GOOGLE OTHER REVENUES

Google other revenues consist primarily of revenues from:

z Google Play, which includes revenues from sales of apps and in-app purchases (which we recognize net of payout to developers)

and digital content sold in the Google Play store;

z hardware, including Google Nest home products, Pixelbooks, Pixel phones and other devices;

z YouTube non-advertising, including YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions and other services; and

z other products and services.

Google other revenues increased $4,697 million from 2019 to 2020. The growth was primarily driven by Google Play and YouTube
non-advertising. Growth for Google Play was primarily driven by sales of apps and in-app purchases, which benefited from elevated
user engagement partially due to the impact of COVID-19. Growth for YouTube non-advertising was primarily driven by an increase
in paid subscribers.

Over time, our growth rate for Google other revenues may be affected by the seasonality associated with new product and service
launches as well as market dynamics.

Google Cloud

Our Google Cloud revenues increased $4,141 million from 2019 to 2020. The growth was primarily driven by GCP followed by our
Google Workspace offerings. Our infrastructure and our data and analytics platform products were the largest drivers of growth in GCP.

Over time, our growth rate for Google Cloud revenues may be affected by customer usage, market dynamics, as well as new product
and service launches.

Use of Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Percentage Change

The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. Our
international revenues are favorably affected as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably affected
as the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. Our revenues are also favorably affected by net hedging gains and
unfavorably affected by net hedging losses.

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues for financial and
operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on
a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) results helps improve the ability
to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core
operating results.

Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period.
We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging
activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency
revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging
effects realized in the current period.

Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in period revenues over prior period revenues
where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded
from revenues of both periods.

These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a
constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are
not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

Costs and Operating Expenses

Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues includes TAC which are paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services,
and amounts paid to Google Network Members primarily for ads displayed on their properties. Our distribution partners include
browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers.

The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network Members’ properties are significantly
higher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google properties (which includes
Google Search & other and YouTube ads), because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network Members’
properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network Members.

Additionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding TAC) includes the following:

z Content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for
distribution on YouTube advertising and subscription services and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on
revenues generated or a flat fee);

z Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses including stock-based compensation
(“SBC”), depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review and customer
support costs). These costs are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate with related changes in revenues; and

z Inventory related costs for hardware we sell.

$

Cost of revenues increased $12,836 million from 2019 to 2020. The increase was due to increases in other cost of revenues and
TAC of $10,147 million and $2,689 million, respectively.

The increase in other cost of revenues from 2019 to 2020 was due to an increase in data center and other operations costs and an
increase in content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube. This increase was partially offset by a decline in hardware costs.

The increase in TAC from 2019 to 2020 was due to increases in TAC paid to distribution partners and to Google Network Members,
driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate was 22.3% in both 2019 and 2020. The TAC rate on Google properties
revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially consistent from 2019 to 2020.

Over time, cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues may be affected by a number of factors, including the following:

z The amount of TAC paid to distribution partners, which is affected by changes in device mix, geographic mix, partner mix, partner
agreement terms such as revenue share arrangements, and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points;

z The amount of TAC paid to Google Network Members, which is affected by a combination of factors such as geographic mix,

product mix, and revenue share terms;

z Relative revenue growth rates of Google properties and Google Network Members’ properties;

z Certain costs that are less variable in nature and may not correlate with the related revenues;

z Costs associated with our data centers and other operations to support ads, Google Cloud, Search, YouTube and other products;

z Content acquisition costs, which are primarily affected by the relative growth rates in our YouTube advertising and subscription

revenues;

z Costs related to hardware sales; and

z Increased proportion of non-advertising revenues, which generally have higher costs of revenues, relative to our advertising revenues.

z Depreciation expenses;

z Equipment-related expenses; and

z Professional services fees primarily related to consulting and outsourcing services.

R&D expenses increased $1,555 million from 2019 to 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expenses
of $1,619 million, largely resulting from a 11% increase in headcount and partially offset by higher compensation charges in certain
Other Bets in 2019. Additionally, the increase in R&D expenses was partially offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses
of $383 million.

Over time, R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues may fluctuate due to certain expenses that are generally less variable in nature
and may not correlate to the changes in revenues. In addition, R&D expenses may be affected by a number of factors including
continued investment in ads, Android, Chrome, Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware, machine learning, Other Bets, Search and
YouTube.

Sales and marketing expenses decreased $518 million from 2019 to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in advertising
and promotional expenses of $1,395 million, as we reduced spending and paused or rescheduled campaigns and changed some
events to digital-only formats as a result of COVID-19, and a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses of $371 million. The
decrease was partially offset by an increase in compensation expenses of $1,347 million, largely resulting from an 8% increase in
headcount.

Over time, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues may fluctuate due to certain expenses that are generally less
variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenues. In addition, sales and marketing expenses may be affected by
a number of factors including the seasonality associated with new product and service launches and strategic decisions regarding
the timing and extent of our spending.

General and administrative expenses increased $1,501 million from 2019 to 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in
compensation expenses of $887 million, largely resulting from a 16% increase in headcount. In addition, there was an increase of
$440 million related to allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable. The increase was partially offset by a $554 million charge
recognized in 2019 relating to a legal settlement.

Over time, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues may fluctuate due to certain expenses that are generally
less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenues, the effect of discrete items such as legal settlements, or
allowances for credit losses for accounts receivable.

European Commission Fines

In March 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AdSense for
Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) fine,
which was accrued in the first quarter of 2019.

Google Services

Google services operating income increased $5,607 million from 2019 to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in
revenues partially offset by increases in content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube, data center and other operations costs, and
TAC. Additionally, there was an increase in operating expenses primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses (including
SBC) largely due to increases in headcount. Operating income benefited from a decline in hardware costs.

Google services operating income increased $5,862 million from 2018 to 2019. The increase was primarily driven by an increase
in revenues partially offset by increases in TAC, data center and other operations costs, and content acquisition costs primarily
for YouTube. Additionally, there was an increase in operating expenses primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses
(including SBC) largely due to an increase in headcount.

Google Cloud

Google Cloud operating loss increased $962 million from 2019 to 2020 and increased $297 million from 2018 to 2019. The increase
in operating loss in both periods was driven by an increase in total expenses of $5,103 million from 2019 to 2020 and $3,377 million
from 2018 to 2019. Operating expenses increased primarily due to compensation expenses (including SBC), largely driven by an
increase in headcount. Additionally, data center and other operating costs increased in both periods.

Other Bets

Other Bets operating loss decreased $348 million from 2019 to 2020 and increased $1,466 million from 2018 to 2019. The fluctuations
were primarily driven by compensation expenses (including SBC).

$

5,394

$

2020

6,858

Other income (expense), net, increased $1,464 million from 2019 to 2020. The change was primarily driven by an increase in net
gains on equity and debt securities of $3,519 million, partially offset by a $902 million loss resulting from our equity derivatives,
which hedged the changes in fair value of certain marketable equity securities, and a decrease in interest income of $562 million.

Over time, other income (expense), net, may be affected by market dynamics and other factors. Equity values generally change daily
for marketable equity securities and upon the occurrence of observable price changes or upon impairment of non-marketable equity
securities. In addition, volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets, including the effects of COVID-19, could result in
a significant change in the value of our investments. Fluctuations in the value of these investments has, and we expect will continue
to, contribute to volatility of OI&E in future periods. For additional information about our investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the

Our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate increased from 2019 to 2020. The increase in the provision for income
taxes and our effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits related to the resolution of multi-year audits in 2019 that did not recur in
2020, higher earnings in countries that have higher statutory rates resulting from the change in our corporate legal entity structure
implemented as of December 31, 2019, and an increase in valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets that are not likely to be
realized relating to certain of our Other Bets, partially offset by an increase in the U.S. federal Foreign-Derived Intangible Income tax
deduction benefits.

We expect our future effective tax rate to be affected by the geographic mix of earnings in countries with different statutory rates.
Additionally, our future effective tax rate may be affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes
in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.

table includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for a fair presentation
of our consolidated financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. Seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and
advertiser expenditures, underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality and macroeconomic conditions have
affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business (including developments and volatility arising from COVID-19). Commercial
queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused, and will likely continue
to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.

Financial Condition

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities

As of December 31, 2020, we had $136.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. Cash equivalents and
marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities,
mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities and marketable equity securities.

Sources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends

Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from
our operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our
cash and capital structure, including the size, pace and form of capital return to stockholders.

Our largest source of cash provided by our operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search & other properties,
Google Network Members’ properties and YouTube ads. Additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps, in-app purchases,
digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees including fees received for Google Cloud offerings and
subscription-based products.

Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include compensation and related costs, payments to our distribution partners
and Google Network Members, and payments for content acquisition costs. In addition, uses of cash from operating activities include
hardware inventory costs, income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2019 to 2020 primarily due to the net effect of increases in cash received
from revenues and cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses, and changes in operating assets and liabilities.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

Cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of our investments in marketable and non-marketable
securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and non-marketable securities, purchases
of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.

Net cash used in investing activities increased from 2019 to 2020 primarily due to a net increase in purchases of securities, partially
offset by decreases in payments for acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. The net decrease in purchases of
property and equipment was driven by decreases in purchases of land and buildings for offices as well as data center construction,
partially offset by increases in purchases of servers.

Cash Used in Financing Activities

Cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of interest in
consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of capital stock, net payments related to
stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.

Net cash used in financing activities increased from 2019 to 2020 primarily due to an increase in cash payments for repurchases of
capital stock, partially offset by increases in net proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of interest in consolidated
entities.

Liquidity and Material Cash Requirements

We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and financing activities to
continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the
next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

As of December 31, 2020, we had long-term taxes payable of $6.5 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a
result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”). As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free

In 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition law and
imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018), and €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion
as of March 20, 2019), respectively. While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other
current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.

In January 2021, we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, a leading wearables brand, for $2.1 billion.

ITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from
this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2020, we had no commercial paper outstanding. As of
December 31, 2020, we have $4.0 billion of revolving credit facilities expiring in July 2023 with no amounts outstanding. The interest
rate for the credit facilities is determined based on a formula using certain market rates.

In August 2020, we issued $10.0 billion of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in six tranches: $1.0 billion due in 2025, $1.0 billion due
in 2027, $2.25 billion due in 2030, $1.25 billion due in 2040, $2.5 billion due in 2050 and $2.0 billion due in 2060. The 2020 Notes
had a weighted average duration of 21.5 years and weighted average coupon rate of 1.57%. Of the total issuance, $5.75 billion was
designated as Sustainability Bonds, the net proceeds of which are used to fund environmentally and socially responsible projects
in the following eight areas: energy efficiency, clean energy, green buildings, clean transportation, circular economy and design,
affordable housing, commitment to racial equity, and support for small businesses and COVID-19 crisis response. The remaining
net proceeds are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2020, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding with
a total carrying value of $13.8 billion. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the debts.

In accordance with the authorizations of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, in 2020 we repurchased and subsequently retired
21.5 million shares of Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of $31.1 billion. As of December 31, 2020, $17.6 billion
remains authorized and available for repurchase. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business
and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions,
including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Capital Expenditures and Leases

We make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets through purchases of
property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products.

Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:

z Technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for compute, storage and networking
requirements for ongoing business activities, including machine learning, (collectively referred to as our information technology
assets) and data center land and building construction; and

z Office facilities, ground up development projects and related building improvements.

Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, our technical infrastructure and office facilities are managed centrally at a consolidated
level. The associated costs, including depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally
based on usage or headcount. Our technical infrastructure investments are designed to support all of Alphabet, including primarily
ads, Google Cloud, Search, and YouTube.

Construction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been placed in service
for our intended use. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend to multiple periods.
For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple phases, where we acquire qualified
land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information technology assets.

During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we spent $23.5 billion and $22.3 billion on capital expenditures and recognized
total operating lease assets of $4.4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the amount of total future lease
payments under operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 9 years, was $15.1 billion. As of December 31,
2020, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $8.0 billion, excluding purchase
options, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2021 and 2026 with
non-cancelable lease terms of 1 to 25 years.

Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our
intended use. Land is not depreciated. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, our depreciation and impairment expenses
on property and equipment were $10.9 billion and $12.9 billion, respectively.

For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs), were $2.4 billion
and $2.9 billion, respectively. Finance leases were not material for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. Please refer to
Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further
information on the leases.

Report on Form 10-K.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K,
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition,
revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors. See
Note 10 included in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information on our commitments and contingencies.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions
that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, gains and losses, as well as related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases,
changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ
materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our
financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that
we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting
estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. We have reviewed our critical
accounting policies and estimates with the audit and compliance committee of our Board of Directors.

Please see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary
of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.

Revenues

For the sale of third-party goods and services, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenues on a gross basis, or an
agent, and report revenues on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services
before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory
risk, and discretion in establishing price.

PART II
ITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax
positions and determining our provision for income taxes.

Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax
outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the
closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the
amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such
determination is made.

The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as
well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by
the Internal Revenue Services (“IRS”) and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the
likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision
for income taxes.

Loss Contingencies

We are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition, intellectual property,
privacy, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services
offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these
matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is
probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible
and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously
accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures
as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss
related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded,
and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could
have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Long-lived Assets

Long-lived assets, including property and equipment, long-term prepayments, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss would
be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount.
Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value.

Fair Value Measurements

We measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt investments, certain other instruments including stock-based compensation
awards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, at fair value
on a nonrecurring basis. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation methods and relevant inputs into
valuation models. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value whereby it gives the highest priority to
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. We
maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Our use of unobservable inputs
reflects the assumptions that market participants would use and may include our own data adjusted based on reasonably available
information. We apply judgment in assessing the relevance of observable market data to determine the priority of inputs under the
fair value hierarchy, particularly in situations where there is very little or no market activity.

In determining the fair values of our non-marketable equity and debt investments, as well as assets acquired (especially with respect
to intangible assets) and liabilities assumed in business combinations, we make significant estimates and assumptions, some of
which include the use of unobservable inputs.

Certain stock-based compensation awards may be settled in the stock of certain of our Other Bets or in cash. These awards are
based on the equity values of the respective Other Bet, which requires use of unobservable inputs.

We also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized investment returns, i.e. performance fees. We recognize
compensation expense based on the estimated payouts, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are
realized, and may require the use of unobservable inputs.

ITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Non-marketable Equity Securities

Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are carried either at fair value or under the
measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or
minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same
issuer. Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the
rights and obligations of the securities. Recording upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of our equity securities
as a result of observable price changes requires quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities using various valuation
methodologies and involves the use of estimates.

Non-marketable equity securities are also subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both
qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant effect on the investment’s fair value. Qualitative factors considered
include the companies’ financial and liquidity position, access to capital resources and the time since the last adjustment to fair value,
among others. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our equity investments
using both the market and income approaches which require judgment and the use of estimates, including discount rates, investee
revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. When our assessment indicates
that an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its fair value.

Change in Accounting Estimate

In January 2021, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and determined we should
adjust the estimated useful life of our servers from three years to four years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment
from three years to five years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2021. For assets that are
in-service as of December 31, 2020, we expect operating results to be favorably impacted by approximately $2.1 billion for the full
fiscal year 2021. The effect of the change may be different due to our capital investments during the fiscal year 2021.

ITEM 7A  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

— ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES

ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity investment risks.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in
foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Principal currencies
hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro and Japanese yen. For the purpose of analyzing foreign
currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably
possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be experienced in the near term.

We use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies
other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign
currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities
are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward contracts.

If an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets, liabilities, and commitments
denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have resulted in an adverse effect
on income before income taxes of approximately $8 million and $497 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, after
consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.

We use foreign currency forwards and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased
and written options) to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency options and forwards reduce the foreign currency losses related to our
earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign currency collars and forwards offset the foreign currency gains related to
our earnings. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements.
We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot
rate changes as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.

If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange
contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $1.1 billion and $912 million lower as of December 31, 2019 and 2020,
respectively. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in
forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.

We use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our
investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign
operations.

If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (“CTA”) within AOCI related to our net
investment hedge would have been approximately $936 million and $1 billion lower as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.
The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from
our investment in foreign subsidiaries.

Interest Rate Risk
Our Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity. We
invest primarily in debt securities including those of the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed
securities, money market and other funds, municipal securities, time deposits, asset backed securities, and debt instruments issued
by foreign governments. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and
floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value
adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest
rates fall. Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared
to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for
which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. We measure securities for which we have not elected the
fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold, less any expected credit losses.

ALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT

PART II
ITEM 7A  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We use value-at-risk (“VaR”) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of our marketable
debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our investment portfolio due to
adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with 95% confidence interval. The estimated one-day
loss in fair value of our marketable debt securities as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 are shown below (in millions):

Actual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity
analyses performed as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and
amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is not intended to represent actual losses
but is used as a risk estimation.

Equity Investment Risk
Our marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially
reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.

Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are investments in
privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.

We record our marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable
market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and represent $3.3 billion and
$5.9 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. A hypothetical adverse price change of 30% on our
December 31, 2020 balance, which could be experienced in the near term, would decrease the fair value of our marketable equity
securities by $1.8 billion. From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable
equity securities.

Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for observable transactions
for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative). The fair value
measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an indication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet
date. These investments, especially those that are in the early stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products
these companies have under development are typically in the early phases and may never materialize and they may experience a
decline in financial condition, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The success
of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the
value of our investments through liquidity events such as public offerings, acquisitions, private sales or other market events. As
of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the
measurement alternative, was $11.4 billion and $18.9 billion, respectively. Valuations of our equity investments in private companies
are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. Volatility in the global economic climate and financial
markets could result in a significant impairment charge relating to our non-marketable equity securities. Changes in valuation of
non-marketable equity securities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities. Additionally,
observable transactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses on our non-marketable equity securities. The effect of
COVID-19 on our impairment assessment requires significant judgment due to the uncertainty around the duration and severity of
the impact.

The carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion as of December 31,
2019 and 2020, respectively, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes, however these investments could be impaired
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.

Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alphabet Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and
2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2020, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control—
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and
our report dated February 2, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to
error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a
test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we
are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts
or disclosures to which it relates.

LOSS CONTINGENCIES

Description
of the Matter

The  Company  is  regularly  subject  to  claims,  suits,  and  government  investigations  involving  competition,
intellectual  property,  privacy,  consumer  protection,  tax,  labor  and  employment,  commercial  disputes,  content
generated by its users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using their platforms, and other
matters.  As  described  in  Note  10  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  “Commitments  and  Contingencies”
such claims could result in adverse consequences.

Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood, and the estimated amount, of a loss related to
such matters. Auditing management’s accounting for and disclosure of loss contingencies from these matters
involved challenging and subjective auditor judgment in assessing the Company’s evaluation of the probability of
a loss, and the estimated amount or range of loss.

How We Addressed
the Matter in
Our Audit

We tested relevant controls over the identified risks associated with management’s accounting for and disclosure
of these matters. This included controls over management’s assessment of the probability of incurrence of a loss
and whether the loss or range of loss was reasonably estimable and the development of related disclosures.

Our audit procedures included gaining an understanding of previous rulings issued by regulators and the status of
ongoing lawsuits, reviewing letters addressing the matters from internal and external legal counsel, meeting with
internal legal counsel to discuss the allegations, and obtaining a representation letter from management on these
matters. We also evaluated the Company’s disclosures in relation to these matters.

/s/ Ernst & Young LLP

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1999.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Alphabet Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Alphabet Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),
the 2020 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 2, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to
the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

— Alphabet Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we
implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (“Alphabet”) became the successor issuer to Google.

We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising, cloud-based solutions that provide customers with
platforms, collaboration tools and services, and sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, digital
content and subscriptions for digital content, and hardware.

Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable
interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
(“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements
and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our
estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses, fair values of financial instruments (including non-marketable
equity securities), intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, and
contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed
to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

As of December 31, 2020 the impact of COVID-19 continues to unfold and the extent of the impact will depend on a number of
factors, including the duration and severity of the pandemic; the uneven impact to certain industries; advances in testing, treatment
and prevention; and the macroeconomic impact of government measures to contain the spread of the virus and related government
stimulus measures. As a result, certain of our estimates and assumptions, including the allowance for credit losses for accounts
receivable, the credit worthiness of customers entering into revenue arrangements, the valuation of non-marketable equity securities,
including our impairment assessment, and the fair values of our financial instruments require increased judgment and carry a higher
degree of variability and volatility that could result in material changes to our estimates in future periods.

In January 2021, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and determined we should
adjust the estimated useful life of our servers from three years to four years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment
from three years to five years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2021.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers and the collectibility of an
amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from revenues.

ADVERTISING REVENUES

We generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on Google Search & other properties, including Google.com, the
Google Search app, Google Play, Gmail and Google Maps; YouTube, and Google Network Members’ properties.

Our customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager and Google Marketing Platform,
among others.

ALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT

53

PART II
ITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

We offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for performance advertising
when a user engages with the advertisement, such as a click, a view, or a purchase. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues
when the ad is displayed or a user views the ad.

For ads placed on Google Network Members’ properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross
basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network
Members’ properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid
to Google Network Members are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the advertising inventory
before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it
is transferred to our customers, and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of
discretion in establishing pricing.

GOOGLE CLOUD REVENUES

Google Cloud revenues consist primarily of fees received for Google Cloud Platform services (which includes infrastructure and data
analytics platform products and other services) and Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) collaboration tools and other enterprise
services. Our cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis. Revenues related to cloud services
provided on a consumption basis are recognized when the customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed.
Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer
receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services.

OTHER REVENUES

Google other revenues and Other Bets revenues consist primarily of revenues from:

z Google Play, which includes revenues from sale of apps and in-app purchases (which we recognize net of payout to developers)

and digital content sold in the Google Play store;

z hardware, including Google Nest home products, Pixelbooks, Pixel phones and other devices;

z YouTube non-advertising services including, YouTube premium and YouTube TV subscriptions and other services; and

z other products and services.

As it relates to Google other revenues, the most significant judgment is determining whether we are the principal or agent for app
sales and in-app purchases through the Google Play store. We report revenues from these transactions on a net basis because
our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a commission.
Consequently, the portion of the gross amount billed to end users that is remitted to app developers is not reflected as revenues.

ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS

Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenues to each
performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the
prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus margin.

CUSTOMER INCENTIVES AND CREDITS

Certain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these
amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that there will not be significant
changes to our estimates of variable consideration.

SALES COMMISSIONS

We expense sales commissions when incurred when the amortization period is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain
sales commissions if we expect the period of benefit of these costs to exceed one year and amortize it over the period of expected
benefit. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.

COST OF REVENUES

Cost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.

TAC represents the amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services and amounts
paid to Google Network Members primarily for ads displayed on their properties. Our distribution partners include browser providers,
mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers.

54

ALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT

PART II
ITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding TAC) includes the following:

z Content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for
distribution on YouTube advertising and subscription services and Google Play. We pay fees to these content providers based on
revenues generated or a flat fee;

z Expenses associated with our data centers and other operations (including bandwidth, compensation expense (including SBC),

depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs); and

z Inventory related costs for hardware we sell.

Software Development Costs

We expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products
to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological feasibility is typically
reached shortly before the release of such products and as a result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were
not material for the periods presented.

Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud based
applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary
project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function
intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented.

Stock-based Compensation

Stock-based compensation primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (“RSUs”). RSUs are equity classified and measured at
the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense using the straight-line attribution method
over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.

For RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our
employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding and the tax withholding is recorded as a
reduction to additional paid-in capital.

Additionally, stock-based compensation also includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (“PSUs”) and
awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bets. PSUs and certain Other Bet awards are equity classified and
expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Certain Other Bet awards are liability classified and remeasured at fair value
through settlement. The fair value of Other Bet awards is based on the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet.

Advertising and Promotional Expenses

We expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2018,
2019 and 2020, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $6.4 billion, $6.8 billion, and $5.4 billion, respectively.

Performance Fees

Performance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized investment returns. We recognize compensation
expense based on the estimated payouts, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized. Performance
fees, which are primarily related to gains on equity securities, are recorded as a component of other income (expense), net.

Certain Risks and Concentrations

Our revenues are primarily derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing. In addition,
our revenues are generated from a multitude of markets in countries around the world. Significant changes in this industry or changes
in customer buying or advertiser spending behavior could adversely affect our operating results.

No individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2018, 2019, or 2020. In 2018,
2019, and 2020, we generated approximately 46%, 46%, and 47% of our revenues, respectively, from customers based in the U.S.

We are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally from cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign exchange
contracts,  and  accounts  receivable.  We  manage  our  credit  risk  exposure  through  timely  assessment  of  our  counterparty
creditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management.

ALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT

ITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of time deposits, money market and other funds, highly liquid debt
instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, debt instruments issued
by municipalities in the U.S., corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. Foreign exchange
contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and
are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. We perform ongoing evaluations to determine customer
credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, marketable securities,
derivative contracts, and non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include
non-marketable equity securities, which are adjusted to fair value when observable price changes are identified or when the non-
marketable equity securities are impaired (referred to as the measurement alternative). Other financial assets and liabilities are carried
at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.

Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and
classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used
to measure fair value:

Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar
instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable
in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and
discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign
exchange rates, and credit ratings.

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.

The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
when measuring fair value.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities

We invest all excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities,
time deposits, and money market funds.

We classify all marketable debt securities that have stated maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash
equivalents and those with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate
such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-
for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt
securities prior to their stated maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly
liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of
stockholders’ equity, except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded in other income (expense),
net. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value are recorded in other
income (expense), net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a specific identification
method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of other income (expense), net.

Our investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses, realized and unrealized,
recognized in other income (expense), net.

Accounts Receivable

Our payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The
term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customers, we require
payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.

We maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable and changes
in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We assess collectibility by
reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify
specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we
consider historical collectibility based on past due status and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based
on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider customer-specific information, current market conditions and reasonable and
supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, our assessment considered the impact of COVID-19 and estimates of expected credit and
collectibility trends. Volatility in market conditions and evolving credit trends are difficult to predict and may cause variability and
volatility that may have a material impact on our allowance for credit losses in future periods. The allowance for credit losses on
accounts receivable was $275 million and $789 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

Inventory

Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is computed using
the first-in, first-out method.

Non-Marketable Investments

We account for non-marketable equity investments through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the
investee under the equity method. Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are primarily
accounted for under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value of our non-marketable
equity investments is adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or
impairment. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are recorded as a
component of other income (expense), net.

Non-marketable debt investments are classified as available-for-sale securities.

Non-marketable investments that do not have stated contractual maturity dates are classified as non-current assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Impairment of Investments

We periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity investments for impairment.

For debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is estimated by considering
available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable
and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to other income (expense), net, not to exceed the amount of the
unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”).
If we have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position
before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as
a component of other income (expense), net.

For non-marketable equity securities we consider whether impairment indicators exist by evaluating the companies’ financial and
liquidity position, access to capital resources and the time since the last adjustment to fair value, among others. If the assessment
indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value by recording the corresponding charge as
a component of other income (expense), net. Fair value is estimated using the best information available, which may include cash
flow projections or other available market data.

Variable Interest Entities

We determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other
variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (“VIE”). We consolidate VIEs when we are the primary beneficiary. We are the
primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of

ALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT

57

PART II
ITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we
account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.

Periodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the
entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets, construction in progress,
leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices, data centers and related building
improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network equipment. We account for property and equipment at
cost less accumulated depreciation. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, which we regularly evaluate. We depreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology
assets generally over periods of three to five years (specifically, three years for servers and three to five years for network equipment).

We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service
for our intended use. Depreciation for equipment, buildings, and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our
intended use. Land is not depreciated.

Leases

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components.
Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance
and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and account for them together as a single
lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.

Certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and
liabilities. These amounts include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on wind or solar production
for power purchase arrangements, and payments for maintenance and utilities.

Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The
interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest
rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on
a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease
terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.
We generally use the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include
any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives.

Operating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet beginning January 1, 2019. The current portion
of our operating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and the long term portion is included in
operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are included in
accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.

Operating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets

We review property and equipment, long-term prepayments and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events
or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of these assets by
comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate.
If the carrying value of the assets or asset group are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by
which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Impairments were not material for the periods presented.

We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting
units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill
using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.

Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We amortize intangible assets on a straight-line
basis with definite lives generally over periods ranging from one to twelve years.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable
for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in
our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted
tax law. We evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance
to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized.

We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical merits, the position
will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based
on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we
recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.

Business Combinations

We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price
of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase
price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized
separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.

Foreign Currency

Generally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of
these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period
derived from month-end exchange rates for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in accumulated
other comprehensive income (AOCI) as a component of stockholders’ equity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and
losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange
gain (loss) in other income (expense), net.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 (“ASU 2016-
13”) “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”, which requires the
measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing
incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss model which requires the use of forward-looking information to calculate
credit loss estimates. It also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment and requires credit losses related to certain
available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized
cost basis of the securities. These changes result in earlier recognition of credit losses. We adopted ASU 2016-13 using the modified
retrospective approach as of January 1, 2020. The cumulative effect upon adoption was not material to our consolidated financial
statements. See “Impairment of Investments” and “Accounts Receivable” above as well as Note 3 for the effect on our consolidated
financial statements.

Deferred Revenues and Remaining Performance Obligations

We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which
are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Our total deferred revenue as of December 31,
2019 was $2.3 billion, of which $1.8 billion was recognized as revenues for the year ending December 31, 2020.

Additionally, we have performance obligations associated with commitments in customer contracts, primarily related to Google
Cloud, for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues, also referred to as remaining performance obligations.
Remaining performance obligations include related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in
future periods, and excludes (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less, (ii) cancellable contracts, and (iii) contracts
for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. As of December 31,
2020, the amount not yet recognized as revenues from these commitments is $29.8 billion. We expect to recognize approximately
half over the next 24 months with the remaining thereafter. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven
by when the customer utilizes the services and our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms, which could impact
our estimate of the remaining performance obligations and when we expect to recognize such as revenues.

Debt Securities

We classify our marketable debt securities, which are accounted for as available-for-sale, within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy
because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable
inputs to determine fair value.

For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other
income (expense), net. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from
related derivative contracts. Unrealized net gains related to debt securities still held where we have elected the fair value option were
$87 million as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of these debt securities was $2 billion. Balances as of
December 31, 2019 were not material.

Equity Investments

The following discusses our marketable equity securities, non-marketable equity securities, gains and losses on marketable and
non-marketable equity securities, as well as our equity securities accounted for under the equity method.

Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and 2 in the
fair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices
for similar instruments in active markets.

Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The
carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar
investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative). Non-marketable equity securities that
have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value
hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction
price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The
fair value of non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3.

the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later.

Cumulative net gains (losses) on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following table (in millions),
represents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity security. While these net gains may
have been reflected in periods prior to the period of sale, we believe they are important supplemental information as they reflect the
economic realized net gains on the securities sold during the period. Cumulative net gains are calculated as the difference between
the sale price and the initial purchase price for the equity security sold during the period.

EQUITY SECURITIES ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD

As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, equity securities accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of approximately
$1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Our share of gains and losses including impairment are included as a component of other
income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 7 for further details on other income (expense), net.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed with
derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings,
and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into
derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.

We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the
derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a
combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values where both the purchased and written options are with the same
counterparty. For other derivative contracts, we present at gross fair values. We primarily record changes in the fair value in the
Consolidated Statements of Income as either other income (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in
AOCI, as discussed below.

We enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same
counterparty. Further, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or pledged when the
net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Cash collateral received related to
derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability.
Cash and non-cash collateral pledged related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in
other current assets.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted
revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less.

Cash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently reclassified
to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude the change in forward points and time value from our
assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded component is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of
the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the
amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding
amounts in AOCI are reclassified to other income (expense), net in the period of de-designation.

As of December 31, 2020, the net accumulated loss on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $124 million,
which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

We designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated
in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized
in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude changes in forward
points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGES

We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our
investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized
in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude changes in forward points from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.

OTHER DERIVATIVES

Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward contracts that we use to hedge
intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of
a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs, are recognized in other income (expense), net, along
with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities.

We also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, equity and commodity
prices, credit exposures and to enhance investment returns.

Note 5. Variable Interest Entities

Consolidated VIEs

We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of operations and financial
position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.

 For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31,
2019 and 2020, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $3.1 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, and
the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.

Total noncontrolling interests (“NCI”), including redeemable noncontrolling interests (“RNCI”), in our consolidated subsidiaries increased
from $1.2 billion to $3.9 billion from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, primarily due to external investments in Waymo.
NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any
period presented and is included within other income (expense), net.

WAYMO

Waymo is an autonomous driving technology development company with a mission to make it safe and easy for people and things
to get where they’re going. In the first half of 2020, Waymo completed an externally led investment round raising in total $3.2 billion,
which includes investment from Alphabet. No gain or loss was recognized. The investments related to external parties were accounted
for as equity transactions and resulted in recognition of noncontrolling interests.

Unconsolidated VIEs

We have investments in some VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily
early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources.

We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly
affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position
of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments as non-marketable equity
investments or equity method investments.

VIEs are generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. We have determined
that the single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure
of these unconsolidated VIEs were not material as of December 31, 2019 and 2020.

Note 6.  Debt

Short-Term Debt

We have a debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program
are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 2020.

Our short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.

Long-Term Debt

In August 2020, Alphabet issued $10.0 billion of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in six tranches (collectively, “2020 Notes”): $1.0 billion
due in 2025, $1.0 billion due in 2027, $2.25 billion due in 2030, $1.25 billion due in 2040, $2.5 billion due in 2050 and $2.0 billion
due in 2060. The 2020 Notes had a weighted average duration of 21.5 years and weighted average coupon rate of 1.57%. Of the
total issuance, $5.75 billion was designated as Sustainability Bonds, the net proceeds of which are used to fund environmentally
and socially responsible projects in the following eight areas: energy efficiency, clean energy, green buildings, clean transportation,
circular economy and design, affordable housing, commitment to racial equity, and support for small businesses and COVID-19 crisis
response. The remaining net proceeds are used for general corporate purposes.

The notes in the table above are comprised of fixed-rate senior unsecured obligations and generally rank equally with each other.
We may redeem the notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The effective interest rates are based on
proceeds received with interest payable semi-annually.

The total estimated fair value of the outstanding notes, including the current portion, was approximately $4.1 billion and $14.0 billion
as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable market prices
of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Note 8.  Acquisitions

2020 Acquisitions

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for total consideration
of approximately $744 million, net of cash acquired. In aggregate, $248 million was attributed to intangible assets, $446 million to
goodwill and $50 million to net assets acquired. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings and
expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas.

Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to the consolidated
results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate.

For all intangible assets acquired and purchased during the year ended December 31, 2020, patents and developed technology have
a weighted-average useful life of 4.1 years, customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 4.7 years, and trade names
and other have a weighted-average useful life of 4.6 years.

Purchase Obligations

As of December 31, 2020, we had $10.7 billion of other non-cancelable contractual obligations, primarily related to data center
operations and build-outs, digital media content licensing, information technology assets and purchases of inventory.

Indemnifications

In the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions in our services and products, we indemnify certain parties, including
advertisers, Google Network Members, customers of Google Cloud offerings, and lessors with respect to certain matters. We have
agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual
property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an
indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with
our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.

It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the
unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have a limited history of prior indemnification
claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us
could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.

As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible.

Legal Matters

ANTITRUST INVESTIGATIONS

On November 30, 2010, the EC’s Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints
against us.

On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping
search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017)
fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring
shopping ads into compliance with the EC’s decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017.

On July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution agreements infringed
European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination
of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision. On October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain
of our Android distribution practices. We recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2018.

On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AdSense for
Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019)
and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners’ agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4,
2019, we appealed the EC decision. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.

PART II
ITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.

From time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on competition matters by regulatory authorities
in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. For example, in August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands
from the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and
certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that
Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. Separately, on December 16, 2020, a number of state
Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against Google in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas,
alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. We
believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. The DOJ and state Attorneys General continue their
investigations into certain aspects of our business. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the United States,
and other regulators around the world.

PATENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS

We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our
products, services, and technologies infringe others’ intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards
of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features,
functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products
or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International
Trade Commission (“ITC”) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate
loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market,
a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products
into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.

Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain intellectual
property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay
significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the
use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and
adversely affect our business.

In 2010, Oracle America, Inc. (“Oracle”) brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of California, alleging that
Google’s Android operating system infringes Oracle’s copyrights related to certain Java application programming interfaces. After
trial, final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of Google on June 8, 2016, and the court decided post-trial motions in
favor of Google. Oracle appealed and on March 27, 2018, the appeals court reversed and remanded the case for a trial on damages.
On May 29, 2018, we filed a petition for a rehearing at the Federal Circuit, and on August 28, 2018, the Federal Circuit denied the
petition. On January 24, 2019, we filed a petition to the Supreme Court of the United States to review this case. On April 29, 2019,
the Supreme Court requested the views of the Solicitor General regarding our petition. On September 27, 2019, the Solicitor General
recommended denying our petition, and we provided our response on October 16, 2019. On November 15, 2019, the Supreme Court
granted our petition and made a decision to review the case. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in our case on October 7,
2020. If the Supreme Court does not rule in our favor, the case will be remanded to the district court for further determination of the
remaining issues in the case, including damages, if any. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and are defending ourselves vigorously.
Given the nature of this case, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, arising from this matter.

OTHER

We are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition,
intellectual property, privacy, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our
users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other
matters. Such claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and
penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing auditing and monitoring obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our
business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our
business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

ALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT

PART II
ITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We record a liability
when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that
a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate
developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and
related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine
both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.

With respect to our outstanding matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible
loss will not, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results
of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.

We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.

NON-INCOME TAXES

We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter
of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and
services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from
examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we
determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible
loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome
may be materially different from our expectations.

For information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 14.

Note 11. Stockholders’ Equity

Convertible Preferred Stock

Our Board of Directors has authorized 100 million shares of convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value, issuable in series. As of
December 31, 2019 and 2020, no shares were issued or outstanding.

Class A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock

Our Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C capital stock. The
rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Each share of Class
A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C
capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any
time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.

Share Repurchases

In July 2020, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $28.0 billion of its Class
C capital stock. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other
investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans.
The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.

During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we repurchased and subsequently retired 15.3 million and 21.5 million shares
of Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of $18.4 billion and $31.1 billion, respectively.

Note 12. Net Income Per Share
We compute net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock using the two-class method. Basic
net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income
per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding
during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive
effect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by
application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes
the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B common stock does not assume the
conversion of those shares.

PART II
ITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock and Class C
capital stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of
incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends
on our Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our
certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock
must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation
provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our
Board of Directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights
of the Class A and Class B common shares and Class C capital stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the
liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.

In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B
common stock and Class C capital stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions
in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.

For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, total stock-based compensation expense was $10.0 billion, $11.7 billion
and $13.4 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $9.4 billion, $10.8 billion, and
$12.8 billion, respectively.

For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we recognized tax benefits on total stock-based compensation expense,
which are reflected in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income, of $1.5 billion, $1.8 billion, and
$2.7 billion, respectively.

For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, tax benefit realized related to awards vested or exercised during the period
was $2.1 billion, $2.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. These amounts do not include the indirect effects of stock-based awards,
which primarily relate to the research and development tax credit.

2019, and 2020 were $14.1 billion, $15.2 billion, and $17.8 billion, respectively.

As of December 31, 2020, there was $22.8 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee RSUs. This
amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years.

401(k) Plans

We have two 401(k) Savings Plans that qualify as deferred salary arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Under these 401(k) Plans, matching contributions are based upon the amount of the employees’ contributions subject to certain
limitations. We recognized expense of approximately $691 million, $724 million, and $855 million for the years ended December 31,
2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively.

Our effective tax rate for 2018 and 2019 was affected significantly by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax
rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate because substantially all of the income from foreign operations was earned by an Irish
subsidiary. As of December 31, 2019, we have simplified our corporate legal entity structure and now license intellectual property
from the U.S. that was previously licensed from Bermuda resulting in an increase in the portion of our income earned in the U.S.

On July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court, in an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, invalidated the portion of the Treasury
regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring related-party participants in a cost sharing arrangement to share stock-based
compensation costs. The U.S. Tax Court issued the final decision on December 28, 2015. As a result of that decision, we recorded a
tax benefit related to the anticipated reimbursement of cost share payment for previously shared stock-based compensation costs.

ITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

On June 7, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned the 2015 Tax Court decision in Altera Corp. v.
Commissioner, and upheld the portion of the Treasury regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring related-party participants in
a cost sharing arrangement to share stock-based compensation costs. As a result of the Ninth Circuit court decision, our cumulative
net tax benefit of $418 million related to previously shared stock-based compensation costs was reversed in the year ended
December 31, 2019.

In 2020, there was an increase in valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets that are not likely to be realized relating to certain
of our Other Bets.

Deferred Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets
and liabilities are as follows (in millions):

Deferred tax assets:

Stock-based compensation expense

Accrued employee benefits

Accruals and reserves not currently deductible

Tax credits

Net operating losses

Operating leases

Intangible assets

As of December 31, 2020, our federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately
$3.1 billion, $3.1 billion, and $1.4 billion respectively. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire
in 2023, foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2024 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will
begin to expire in 2028. It is more likely than not that certain net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized; therefore, we have
recorded a valuation allowance against them. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under
the tax laws of the different jurisdictions.

As of December 31, 2020, our California research and development credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately
$3.7 billion that can be carried over indefinitely. We believe the state tax credit is not likely to be realized.

As of December 31, 2020, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to California deferred tax assets, certain federal net
operating losses, certain state tax credits, net deferred tax assets relating to certain of our Other Bets, and certain foreign net operating
losses that we believe are not likely to be realized. We continue to reassess the remaining valuation allowance quarterly and if future
evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.

The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $4.7 billion, $3.4 billion, and $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2018, 2019, and
2020, respectively, of which, $2.9 billion, $2.3 billion, and $2.6 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively.
The decrease in gross unrecognized tax benefits in 2019 was primarily as a result of the resolution of multi-year audits.

As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we accrued $130 million and $222 million in interest and penalties in provision for income taxes,
respectively.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions, our two major tax jurisdictions
are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax
authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2018 tax returns. We have also received tax assessments in multiple
foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend any and all such
claims as presented.

The tax years 2011 through 2019 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes.
There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.

We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision
for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the
expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.

We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the
outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not
consistent with management’s expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution
occurs. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible
that our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months.

Note 15. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, we report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:

z Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and
YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products,
and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.

z Google Cloud includes Google’s infrastructure and data analytics platforms, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise
customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services and Google
Workspace (formerly known as G Suite) collaboration tools.

z Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from the Other Bets are

derived primarily through the sale of internet services as well as licensing and R&D services.

Revenues and certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering, and hardware costs
and other operating expenses, are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and
expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. The associated costs,
including depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage or headcount.

Unallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and legal, including fines
and settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared research and development activities. Additionally, hedging gains
(losses) related to revenue are included in corporate costs.

Our Chief Operating Decision Maker does not evaluate operating segments using asset information.

— ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance
that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We rely extensively on information systems to manage our business and summarize and report operating results. In 2019, we began
a multi-year implementation of a new global ERP system, which will replace much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP
system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management
and provide timely information to our management team. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several
years. The initial phase, which included changes to our general ledger and consolidated financial reporting systems, was completed
during the third quarter of 2020. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. However, as the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we will change our processes
and procedures, which in turn, could result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting. As such changes occur, we will
evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

As a result of COVID-19, our global workforce continued to operate primarily in a work from home environment for the quarter ended
December 31, 2020. While pre-existing controls were not specifically designed to operate in our current work from home operating
environment, we believe that our internal controls over financial reporting continue to be effective. We have continued to re-evaluate and
refine our financial reporting process to provide reasonable assurance that we could report our financial results accurately and timely.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit and
Compliance Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited
by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition,
the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
