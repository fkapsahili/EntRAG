It led us to be a pioneer in the development of AI and, since 2016, \nan AI-first company. We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO, Sundar Pichai.\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, \nGoogle Services and Google Cloud, and all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Alphabet's structure is \nabout helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence. \nAccess and Technology for Everyone\nThe Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people, and businesses large and \nsmall. Our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant \ntoday as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find \nanswers to a company that also helps people get things done. \nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools \nthey need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information \nand make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year. \nYouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new. Google Assistant \noffers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices, providing intelligent help throughout a \nperson's day, no matter where they are. Google Cloud helps customers solve today’s business challenges, improve \nproductivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and building new products \nand features that will help our users, partners, customers, and communities and have invested more than $150 billion \nin research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.\nMaking AI Helpful for Everyone\nAI is a transformational technology that can bring meaningful and positive change to people and societies across \nthe world, and for our business. At Google, we have been bringing AI into our products and services for more than a \ndecade and making them available to our users. Our journey began in 2001, when machine learning was first \nincorporated into Google Search to suggest better spellings to users searching the web. Today, AI in our products is \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n4.  \n\nused by billions of people globally through features like autocomplete suggestions in Google Search; translation across \n133 languages in Google Translate; and organization, searching, and editing in Google Photos.\nLarge language models (LLMs) are an exciting aspect of our work in AI based on deep learning architectures, \nsuch as the Transformer, a neural network architecture that we introduced in 2017 that helped with language \nunderstanding. This led to the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, or BERT, in 2019 that helped \nSearch understand the intent of user search queries better than ever before.\nGoogle was a company built in the cloud, and we continue to invest in our Google Cloud offerings, including \nGoogle Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, to help organizations stay at the forefront of AI innovation with our AI-\noptimized infrastructure, mature AI platform and world-class models, and assistive agents.\nWe believe AI can solve some of the hardest societal, scientific and engineering challenges of our time. For \nexample, in 2020, Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge. Since then, \nwe have open-sourced to the scientific community 200 million of AlphaFold’s protein structures which are used to work \non everything from accelerating new malaria vaccines to advancing cancer drug discovery and developing plastic-\neating enzymes. As another example, AI can also have a transformative effect on climate progress by providing helpful \ninformation, predicting climate-related events, and optimizing climate action. Using advanced AI and geospatial \nanalysis, Google Research has developed flood forecasting models that can provide early warning and real-time \nflooding information to communities and individuals. \nAs AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on giving helpful features to our users and customers as we \ndeliver on our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. With a bold \nand responsible approach, we continue to take the next steps to make this technology even more helpful for everyone.\nDeliver the Most Advanced, Safe, and Responsible AI\nWe aim to build the most advanced, safe, and responsible AI with models that are developed, trained, and \nrigorously tested at scale powered by our continued investment in AI technical infrastructure. In December 2023, we \nlaunched Gemini, our most capable and general model. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means \nit can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information, including \ntext, code, audio, images, and video. Our teams across Alphabet will leverage Gemini, as well as other AI models we \nhave previously developed and announced, across our business to deliver the best product and service experiences \nfor our users, advertisers, partners, customers, and developers.\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means developing AI in a way that \nmaximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing the challenges, guided by our AI Principles. We published \nthese in 2018, as one of the first companies to articulate principles that put beneficial use, users, safety, and avoidance \nof harms above business considerations. While there is natural tension between being bold and being responsible, we \nbelieve it is possible — and in fact critical — to embrace that tension productively.\nEnable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud\nAI is not only a powerful enabler, it is also a major platform shift. Globally, businesses from startups to large \nenterprises, and the public sector are thinking about how to drive transformation. That is why we are focused on \nmaking it easy and scalable for others to innovate, and grow, with AI. That means providing the most advanced \ncomputing infrastructure and expanding access to Google’s latest AI models that have been rigorously tested in our \nown products. Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train, tune, augment, and deploy applications using \ngenerative AI models and services such as Enterprise Search and Conversations. Duet AI for Google Cloud provides \npre-packaged AI agents that assist developers to write, test, document, and operate software.\nImprove Knowledge, Learning, Creativity, and Productivity\nThings that we now consider routine – like spell check, mobile check deposit, or Google Search, Google \nTranslate, and Google Maps – all use AI. As AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on giving helpful features \nto our users as we continue to deliver on our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally \naccessible and useful.\nWhile we have been integrating AI into our products for years, we are now embedding the power of generative AI \nto continue helping our users express themselves and get things done. For example, Duet AI in Google Workspace \nhelps users write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings. Bard allows users to \ncollaborate with experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support, and app integration. \nDream Screen, a new experimental feature in YouTube, allows for the creation of AI-generated video or image \nbackgrounds to Shorts by typing an idea into a prompt.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n5.  \n\nWe also know businesses of all sizes around the world rely on Google Ads to find customers and grow their \nbusinesses — and we make that even easier with AI. With Performance Max, advertisers simply tell us their campaign \ngoals and share their creative assets, and AI will automatically produce and run a highly effective ad campaign across \nall of Google’s properties, to meet their budget. Product Studio brings the benefits of AI to businesses of all sizes, \nhelping them easily create uniquely-tailored imagery featuring their products — for free. Additionally, we are \nexperimenting with Search and Shopping ads that are directly integrated into the AI-powered snapshot and \nconversational mode in Search Generative Experience.\nBuild the Most Helpful Personal Computing Platforms and Devices\nOver the years, our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on \ntop of it. Our latest Pixel devices were built around AI, bringing the best AI-assistive experiences to our users, such as \nBest Take, Magic Editor, and Audio Magic Eraser. As we look ahead, we are designing our Android and Chrome \noperating systems with new AI-forward user experiences. \nMoonshots\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This \nincrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not \nevolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, \nbut those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. \nOur early investments in AI started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central to \nfuture developments. We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term, most notably for the \napplication of AI to our products and services, as well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing. As \nwe said in the original founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as \nthey are the key to our long-term success.\nPrivacy and Security\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are \nnear-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default; \nstrictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that \nput people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete \ntheir data, giving them tools, such as My Ad Center, to control their ad experience, or advancing anti-malware, anti-\nphishing, and password security features.\nGoogle\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\nGoogle Services\nServing Our Users\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people \nworldwide. Our product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most \nrecognized in the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Gmail, \nGoogle Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by \nusers around the world.\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than 25 years ago. \nWhile Google Search started as a way to find web pages, organized into ten blue links, we have driven technical \nadvancements and product innovations that have transformed Google Search into a dynamic, multimodal experience. \nWe first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search, making it easier to navigate on smaller \nscreens. As new types of content surfaced on the internet, Universal Search made it possible to search multiple \ncontent types, like news, images, videos, and more, to deliver rich, relevant results. The introduction of new search \nmodalities, like voice and visual search, made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive \nways. We took that a step further with multisearch, which lets people search with text and images at the same time. \nLarge language models like BERT and Multitask Unified Models, or MUMs, have made it possible to express more \nnatural language queries, vastly improving the quality of results. Each advancement has made it easier and more \nnatural for people to find what they are looking for.\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery \nand creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are \nconsuming many forms of digital content, including watching videos, streaming TV, playing games, listening to music, \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n6.  \n\nreading books, and using apps. Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people \naround the world to create and find great digital content.\nFueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and devices. That is why we continue to \ninvest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as well \nas growing our family of devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people's lives easier \nby combining the best of our AI, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices, \nsuch as the new Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, and the Pixel Watch 2. Creating products and services that people rely on \nevery day is a journey that we are investing in for the long-term.\nHow We Make Money\nWe have built world-class advertising technologies for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital \nmarketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide \nrange of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads \nat the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. AI has been foundational to our \nadvertising business for more than a decade. Products like Performance Max and Product Studio use the full power of \nour AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities.\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears \non Google Search & other properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners' properties (\"Google Network \nproperties\"). We continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of \nadvertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\n•\nPerformance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct \nengagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving \nmeasurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n•\nBrand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity for advertisers' products and services, \nthrough videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand \nadvertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing \ncampaigns. \nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. \nWe focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering \nout invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and \nvideos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\nIn addition, Google Services increasingly generates revenues from products and services beyond advertising, \nincluding:\n•\nconsumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, \nYouTube Music and Premium,  and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\n•\nplatforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases; \nand\n•\ndevices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices.\nGoogle Cloud\nThrough our Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace offerings, Google Cloud generates revenues \nprimarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools and other \ncloud services. Customers use five key capabilities from Google Cloud.\n•\nAI-optimized Infrastructure: provides open, reliable, and scalable compute, networking, and storage to \nenable customers to run workloads anywhere — on our Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. It can be \nused to migrate and modernize IT systems and to train and serve various types of AI models. \n•\nCybersecurity: helps customers detect, protect, and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats, with \nAI integrated to further strengthen security outcomes, prioritize which threats to investigate, and identify attack \npaths, as well as accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats. \n•\nDatabases and Analytics: provides a variety of different types of databases — relational, key-value, in-\nmemory — to store and manage data for different types of applications. Our Data Cloud also unifies data \nlakes, data warehouses, data governance, and advanced machine learning into a single platform that can \nanalyze data across any cloud.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n7.  \n\n•\nCollaboration Tools: Google Workspace and Duet AI in Google Workspace provide easy-to-use, secure \ncommunication and collaboration tools, including apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet, and more. \nThese tools enable secure hybrid and remote work, boosting productivity and collaboration. AI has been used \nin Google Workspace for years to improve grammar, efficiency, security, and more with features like Smart \nReply, Smart Compose, and malware and phishing protection in Gmail. Duet AI in Google Workspace helps \nusers write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings.\n•\nAI Platform and Duet AI for Google Cloud: Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train, tune, \naugment, and deploy applications using generative AI models and services such as Enterprise Search and \nConversations. Duet AI for Google Cloud provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers to write, test, \ndocument, and operate software.\nOther Bets\n Across Alphabet, we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries \nfrom improving transportation and health technology to exploring solutions to address climate change. Alphabet’s \ninvestment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at various stages of development, ranging from \nthose in the R&D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become \nthriving, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own \nboards with independent members and outside investors. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with \nconsiderable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their \nindustries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet \nservices.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable \ncompetition in every aspect of our business, including, among others, from:\n•\ngeneral purpose search engines and information services;\n•\nvertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries related to travel, jobs, and health, which users \nmay navigate directly to rather than go through Google;\n•\nonline advertising platforms and networks;\n•\nother forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers \ntypically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline;\n•\ndigital content and application platform providers;\n•\nproviders of enterprise cloud services;\n•\ndevelopers and providers of AI products and services;\n•\ncompanies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that \nhave developed proprietary platforms;\n•\nproviders of digital video services; \n•\nsocial networks, which users may rely on for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information \nthrough traditional search engines;\n•\nproviders of workspace communication and connectivity products; and \n•\ndigital assistant providers.\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and \ntechnologies to the marketplace across our businesses. For example, for advertising, competing successfully depends \non attracting and retaining:\n•\nusers, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance \nof our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n•\nadvertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver \ntheir advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n•\ncontent providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners \ngenerate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n8.  \n\nFor additional information about competition, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nOngoing Commitment to Sustainability\nWe believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect our planet. Sustainability is one of \nour core values at Google, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. We have been a leader on \nsustainability and climate change since Google’s founding more than 25 years ago. \nOur sustainability work is focused on empowering individuals to take action, working together with our partners \nand customers, and working to reduce our carbon footprint across our operations and supply chain.\nIn 2020, we shared our aspiration to help individuals, cities, and other partners collectively reduce one gigaton of \ntheir carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030. This is an ambitious vision that we have set to push us to \ncontribute meaningfully to helping with climate solutions beyond our own operations and value chain. \nIn 2021, we set an ambitious goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, by \n2030. To accomplish this, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 \nabsolute emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based \ncarbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions. We have formally committed to the Science Based \nTargets initiative to seek their validation of our absolute emissions reduction target. \nOne of the key levers for reducing emissions from our operations is transitioning to clean energy. Since 2017, we \nhave matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our global operations with purchases of renewable energy on an \nannual basis. However, because of differences in the availability of renewable energy sources like solar and wind \nacross the regions where we operate—and because of the variable supply of these resources—we still need to rely on \ncarbon-emitting energy sources that power local grids. That is why we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy \n(CFE) on every grid where we operate by 2030.\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals. We also know that our path \nto net-zero emissions will not be easy or linear. Some of our plans may take years to deliver results, particularly where \nthey involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. So as our business continues to evolve, we \nexpect our emissions to rise before dropping towards our absolute emissions reduction target.\nTo benefit the people and places where we operate, we have set goals to replenish 120% of the freshwater \nvolume we consume, on average, across our offices and data centers by 2030 and to help restore and improve the \nquality of water and health of ecosystems in the communities where we operate. \nWe also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains. Our \ncircularity principles focus on designing out waste from the start, keeping materials in use for as long as possible, and \npromoting healthy materials—for our data centers, workplaces, and products.\nMore information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports, including \nGoogle’s Environmental Report. The contents of our sustainability reports are not incorporated by reference into this \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC. For additional information about \nrisks and uncertainties applicable to our commitments to attain certain sustainability goals, see Item 1A Risk Factors of \nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCulture and Workforce\nWe are a company of curious, talented, and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and \nencourage the iteration of ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society.\nOur people are critical for our continued success, so we work hard to create an environment where employees \ncan have fulfilling careers, and be happy, healthy, and productive. We offer industry-leading benefits and programs to \ntake care of the diverse needs of our employees and their families, including opportunities for career growth and \ndevelopment, resources to support their financial health, and access to excellent healthcare choices. Our competitive \ncompensation programs help us to attract and retain top candidates, and we will continue to invest in recruiting \ntalented people to technical and non-technical roles, and rewarding them well. We provide a variety of high quality \ntraining and support to managers to build and strengthen their capabilities-–ranging from courses for new managers, to \nlearning resources that help them provide feedback and manage performance, to coaching and individual support.\nAt Alphabet, we are committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a \nworkforce that is representative of the users we serve. More information on Google’s approach to diversity can be \nfound in our annual diversity reports, available publicly at diversity.google. The contents of our diversity reports are not \nincorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the \nSEC.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n9.  \n\n As of December 31, 2023, Alphabet had 182,502 employees. We have work councils and statutory employee \nrepresentation obligations in certain countries, and we are committed to supporting protected labor rights, maintaining \nan open culture, and listening to all employees. Supporting healthy and open dialogue is central to how we work, and \nwe communicate information about the company through multiple internal channels to our employees.\nWhen necessary we contract with businesses around the world to provide specialized services where we do not \nhave appropriate in-house expertise or resources, often in fields that require specialized training like cafe operations, \ncontent moderation, customer support, and physical security. We also contract with temporary staffing agencies when \nwe need to cover short-term leaves, when we have spikes in business needs, or when we need to quickly incubate \nspecial projects. We choose our partners and staffing agencies carefully, and review their compliance with Google’s \nSupplier Code of Conduct. We continually make improvements to promote a respectful and positive working \nenvironment for everyone — employees, vendors, and temporary staff alike.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to numerous United States (U.S.) federal, state, and local, as well as foreign laws and regulations \ncovering a wide variety of subjects, and the scope of this coverage continues to broaden with continuing new legal and \nregulatory developments in the U.S. and internationally. Like other companies in the technology industry, we face \nincreasingly heightened scrutiny from both U.S. and foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and \nregulations. Many of these laws and regulations are evolving and their applicability and scope, as interpreted by the \ncourts, remain uncertain. Particularly with regard to AI; climate change and sustainability; competition; consumer \nprotection; content moderation; data privacy and security; news publications; and reporting on human capital and \ndiversity, we have seen an increase in new and evolving laws and regulations, as well as related enforcement actions \nand investigations, being proposed and implemented in recent years by legislative and regulatory bodies around the \nworld.\nOur compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could, individually or in the aggregate, \nincrease our cost of doing business, make our products and services less useful, limit our ability to pursue certain \nbusiness models, cause us to change our business practices, affect our competitive position relative to our peers, and/\nor otherwise harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Item 1A Risk Factors; \nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect in Part II, Item 7; and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to \nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our \nproprietary technology and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international \ntrademarks, service marks, domain names, and copyrights. We have also filed patent applications in the U.S. and \nforeign countries covering certain of our technology, and acquired patent assets to supplement our portfolio. We have \nlicensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our rights to other parties.

Reduced spending by advertisers, a \nloss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize \nads could harm our business. \nWe generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers, \ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their \ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value \n(such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective \nmonetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, such as \nour initiatives to phase out third-party cookies, as well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy \npractices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, \ntechnologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, \nand some providers of online services have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability \nand functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively \nand competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse \nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in \nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and \noperating results. \nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that \nare useful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our \nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results. \nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing \ntechnologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, \nwe must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, \nand technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a \nwider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in technical infrastructure and \nR&D, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology, products, and services. \nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international \ncompetitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer \noperating histories and well-established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources \nin ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions and entering into other strategic \narrangements; continuing to invest heavily in technical infrastructure, R&D, and in talent; initiating intellectual property \nand competition claims (whether or not meritorious); and continuing to compete for users, advertisers, customers, and \ncontent providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to \naggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our \ncompetitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the \nneed for products and services before we do. \nWe are expanding our investment in AI across the entire company. This includes generative AI and continuing to \nintegrate AI capabilities into our products and services. AI technology and services are highly competitive, rapidly \nevolving, and require significant investment, including development and operational costs, to meet the changing needs \nand expectations of our existing users and attract new users. Our ability to deploy certain AI technologies critical for \nour products and services and for our business strategy may depend on the availability and pricing of third-party \nequipment and technical infrastructure. Additionally, other companies may develop AI products and technologies that \nare similar or superior to our technologies or more cost-effective to deploy. Other companies may also have (or in the \nfuture may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, \nor sell our own AI products and services.\nOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the \nevolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. As new and \nexisting technologies continue to develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are, or \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n11.  \n\nthat are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. These technologies could reduce usage of our products \nand services, and force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources to develop and operate equal \nor better products and services. Competitors’ success in providing compelling products and services or in attracting \nand retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers could harm our financial condition and \noperating results. \nOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and \ncould divert management attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies in a \nwide range of industries beyond online advertising. The investments that we are making across our businesses, such \nas building AI capabilities into new and existing products and services, reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and \nprovide products and services that are helpful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our \ninvestments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in \npursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities. Innovations in our products and services could also \nresult in changes to user behavior and affect our revenue trends. These endeavors involve significant risks and \nuncertainties, including diversion of resources and management attention from current operations, different \nmonetization models, and the use of alternative investment, governance, or compensation structures that may fail to \nadequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in devices, including our smartphones, home devices, and \nwearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid \nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, increased market saturation in developed countries, short \nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in performance characteristics, and price and \nfeature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide \ndevices that compete effectively. \nWithin Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, \nincluding Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, and we are advancing our AI platforms and models to \nsupport these tools and technologies. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud \ncomputing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales force. At the \nsame time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models \nare competitive and constantly evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business \nobjectives. Further, our business with public sector customers may present additional risks, including regulatory \ncompliance risks. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply or \nany deficiencies found may expose us to legal, financial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations may \nrequire us to make new capital investments, build new products, and seek partners to deliver localized services in \nother countries, and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements. \nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among \nothers. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and \nour offerings, many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be \nable to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability. \nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, raise ethical, technological, \nlegal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and \nservices. Because all of these investment areas are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies \nand offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we may experience downward pressure on our \noperating margin in the future. \nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the \ndevices and modalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines \nin advertiser spending; competition; customer usage and demand for our products; decreases in our pricing of our \nproducts and services; ongoing product and policy changes; and shifts to lower priced products and services. \nIn addition, we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors, \nsuch as an increase in the mix of lower-margin products and services, in particular from the continued expansion of our \nbusiness into new fields, including products and services such as our devices, Google Cloud, and consumer \nsubscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those \nwe generate from advertising. In particular, margins on our devices have had, and may continue to have, an adverse \neffect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. We may also experience \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n12.  \n\ndownward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increasing costs \nfor many aspects of our business. Further, certain of our costs and expenses are generally less variable in nature and \nmay not correlate to changes in revenue. We may also not be able to execute our efforts to re-engineer our cost base \nsuccessfully or in a timely manner. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue \ngrowth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. For additional information, \nsee Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect and Revenues and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. \nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of \nour products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete. \nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for \nus. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, \nservices, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country \nin which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have \ntaken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection \nfor our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have \nadequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the \npossibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or \nunenforceable. \nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and \nother sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting \nfrom these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word \n“Google” could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” Some courts have \nruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S., \nmay reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in \nother people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand. \nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. \nAlso, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of \nour intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating \nresults. \nOur business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our \nability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. \nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the \nbrands within Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch \nnew and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content \nproviders, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of \nfactors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and \nsecurity issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to respond \nappropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable \npractices by advertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our \nbrands. \nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, \nand operating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to \nprovide high-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a \nrange of settings. \nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial \ncondition, and operating results. \nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability \nto supply both our products and our services. \nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our devices and servers and networking \nequipment used in our technical infrastructure, and we may supply the contract manufacturers with components to \nassemble the devices and equipment. We also rely on other companies to participate in the supply of components and \ndistribution of our products and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these \ncompanies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n13.  \n\nobligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other \nmaterial terms of our arrangements with them. \nWe have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages, price increases, quality issues, and/\nor longer lead times that could negatively affect our operations, driven by raw material, component availability, \nmanufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, logistics capacity, inflation, foreign currency exchange \nrates, tariffs, sanctions and export controls, trade disputes and barriers, forced labor concerns, sustainability sourcing \nrequirements, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters or pandemics, the effects of climate change \n(such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns \nassociated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, and significant changes in the financial \nor business condition of our suppliers. Some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and our devices \nare available from only one or limited sources, and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms \nin the event of a supply chain disruption. A significant supply interruption that affects us or our vendors could delay \ncritical data center upgrades or expansions and delay consumer product availability. \nWe may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and \nconditions. We may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological \nchange, changed consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of \nour hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of sales \nof our devices decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing \ncosts or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our \nfinancial condition and operating results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable \ncontractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and \nmay affect our supply. \nOur devices have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, or \noperations. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or \nsuppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are \ndefective or require a recall, it could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nWe require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies \nand practices, such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data \nsecurity, environmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. \nViolations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key \nrelationships, and damage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property \ncould affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims. \nInterruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications \nsystems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our \nreputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nThe availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing \noperation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage, \ninterference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters \nor pandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, export controls and sanctions, the effects of climate change \n(such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns \nassociated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, utility outages, telecommunications \nfailures, computer viruses, software bugs, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, computer denial of service \nattacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our data centers are located in \nareas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, \nsabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions resulting from problems \nexperienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts happening in the area. \nSome of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The \noccurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic, closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems affecting our data \ncenters could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical \nand complex and have contained in the past, and may contain in the future, errors or vulnerabilities, which could result \nin interruptions in or failure of our services or systems. Any of these incidents could impede or prevent us from \neffectively offering products and providing services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating \nresults. \nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, financial \ncondition, and operating results.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n14.  \n\nOur international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow \ninternationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 53% of our consolidated revenues in 2023. In \naddition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the \nfollowing:\n•\nrestrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent \nus from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;\n•\nsanctions, import and export controls, other market access barriers, political unrest, geopolitical tensions, \nchanges in regimes, or armed conflict (such as ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine), any of which \nmay affect our business continuity, increase our operating costs, limit demand for our products and services, \nlimit our ability to source components or final products, or prevent or impede us from operating in certain \njurisdictions, complying with local laws, or offering products or services;\n•\nlonger payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;\n•\nan evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to litigation, \nnew regulatory costs and challenges (including new customer requirements), uncertainty regarding regulatory \noutcomes, and other liabilities under local laws that may not offer due process or clear legal precedent;\n•\nanti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain \npayments to government officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties; and\n•\ndifferent employee/employer relationships, existence of works councils and differing labor practices, and other \nchallenges caused by distance, language, local expertise, and cultural differences, increasing the complexity \nof doing business in multiple jurisdictions.\nBecause we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, \nwe have faced, and will continue to face, exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we \nhedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. \ndollar and foreign currencies have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our revenues and earnings. \nHedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial \ncondition and operating results. \nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial \nstatements incorporate inherently subjective valuation methodologies. \nThe fair value of our debt and equity investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the \npast, negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying \nentities, foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation \nof new benchmark rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors. \nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-\nbased compensation awards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in \na business combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, which is inherently subjective and requires management \njudgment and estimation. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&E, which \nincreases the volatility of our OI&E. The unrealized gains and losses or impairments we record from fair value \nremeasurements in any particular period may differ significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately realize on such \ninvestments.  \nAs a result of these factors, the value of our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition \nand operating results. \nRisks Related to our Industry \nPeople access our products and services through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to \nevolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely \nadopt versions of our products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed. \nPeople access our products and services through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, \nmobile phones, smartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables \n(including virtual reality and augmented reality devices), automobiles, and television-streaming devices. Our products \nand services may be less popular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical \nstandards for its devices, and our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited \nfunctionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to \ninclude our products on their devices. In addition, search queries may be undertaken via voice-activated search, apps, \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n15.  \n\nsocial media or other platforms, which could harm our business. It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter \nin adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue \nto devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices. \nFailing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and \nusers, or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our \nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities. \nIssues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm and increased liability exposure. \nOur evolving AI-related efforts may give rise to risks related to harmful content, inaccuracies, discrimination, \nintellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and other issues. As a \nresult of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could \nsubject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability (including under new and proposed legislation and \nregulations), new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or \nreputational harm. \nSome uses of AI will present ethical issues and may have broad effects on society. In order to implement AI \nresponsibly and minimize unintended harmful effects, we have already devoted and will continue to invest significant \nresources to develop, test, and maintain our products and services, but we may not be able to identify or resolve all AI-\nrelated issues, deficiencies, and/or failures before they arise. Unintended consequences, uses, or customization of our \nAI tools and systems may negatively affect human rights, privacy, employment, or other social concerns, which may \nresult in claims, lawsuits, brand or reputational harm, and increased regulatory scrutiny, any of which could harm our \nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\nData privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our \nreputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from \nusing our products and services. Computer viruses, software bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks \non our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users’ \nand customers’ ability to use our products and services, harming our business and reputation. \nConcerns about, including the adequacy of, our practices with regard to the collection, use, governance, \ndisclosure, or security of personal data or other data-privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our \nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as \nexpectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change. \nOur products and services involve the storage, handling, and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive \ninformation. Software bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, and security breaches \nexpose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information, which could result in litigation and other \npotential liabilities, including regulatory fines and penalties, as well as reputational harm. Additionally, our products \nincorporate highly technical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and \nare likely in the future to contain, undetected errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities. We continue to add new features \ninvolving AI to our offerings and internal systems, and features that rely on AI may be susceptible to unanticipated \nsecurity threats as our and the market’s understanding of AI-centric security risks and protection methods continue to \ndevelop. We have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, some errors in our software code only after \nwe have released the code. Systems and control failures, security breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, \nand/or inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in government and legal exposure, seriously harm our \nreputation, brand, and business, and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers. Such incidents have \noccurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our products and services. While there \nis no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage, we expect to continue to expend significant \nresources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs, theft, misuse, and security vulnerabilities or \nbreaches. \nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. \nCyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods \nof time. We have seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, which could affect \nour or other parties’ systems. We expect to continue to experience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. Our \nefforts to address undesirable activity on our platform may also increase the risk of retaliatory attack. In addition, we \nface the risk of cyber attacks by nation-states and state-sponsored actors. These attacks may target us or our \ncustomers, particularly our public sector customers (including federal, state, and local governments). Geopolitical \ntensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine, may increase these risks. \nWe may experience security issues, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, system errors, or \nvulnerabilities in our or other parties’ systems. While we may not determine some of these issues to be material at the \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n16.  \n\ntime they occur and may remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in \nsignificant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries, enforcement actions, litigation, and \nnegative publicity. There is also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a \nlater date in the aggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. Because the \ntechniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage \nsystems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a target, even taking all \nreasonable precautions, including those required by law, we have been unable in the past and may continue to be \nunable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures. \nFurther, if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data-\nsecurity practices, fail to comply with our terms and policies, or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach, our \nusers’ data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. If an actual or perceived breach of our or our business \npartners’ or service providers’ security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures \nwould be harmed, we could lose users and customers, our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be \ncompromised, and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may \ninclude class-action litigation) and regulatory actions, fines, and penalties. Any of the foregoing consequences could \nharm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nWhile we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including \ndedicated worldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or \npandemic, may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to \nprevent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal, \nreputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nFor additional information, see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under ‘Risks Related \nto Laws, Regulations, and Policies’ below.\nOur ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of \nour platforms and misuse of user data. \nIn addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety, \nsecurity, and review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties, \nincluding investigation and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services. \nAs a result of these efforts, we have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, incidents of unnecessary \naccess to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. However, we may not have discovered, \nand may in the future not discover, all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data limitations, including \nour lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, or other factors, including factors \noutside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic, and we may learn of such incidents or activity via third \nparties. Such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our \nterms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper ad \npurchases, activities that threaten people’s safety on- or off-line, or instances of spamming, scraping, or spreading \ndisinformation. While we may not determine some of these incidents to be material at the time they occurred and we \nmay remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal, financial, \nand reputational harm, including government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. There \nis also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the \naggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. \nWe may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such \nincidents. Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation \nand brands, require us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations, and adversely \naffect our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and \nregulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management’s time and attention, \nand lead to enhanced regulatory oversight. \nProblematic content on our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content \nfarms, and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could harm our \nreputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services. \nWe, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms, including \nsophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate \nrevenues, or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent. While we invest \nsignificantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and \ninvalid traffic, we have been unable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuses or promote \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n17.  \n\nuniformly high-quality content. Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new avenues of \nabuse for bad actors.\nMany websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in \nsearch results than our search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have \naffected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading, \nor undesirable content. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam \nin most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their \nrankings. Although we continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our \nplatforms, there is no guarantee that our technology will always be successful, and our users may have negative \nexperiences on our platforms if our technology fails to work as intended, which may affect our users' decisions in \ncontinuing to use our platforms. We also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, \nincluding content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve \ntheir search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent abuse from \nlow-quality websites, but we may not always be successful. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including \nviolations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference, activities that threaten \nthe safety and/or well-being of our users on- or off-line, and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation. \nIf we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality \ncontent, it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our \nfinancial condition and operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in \nmonetary penalties and damages and divert management’s time and attention. \nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet \naccess providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and \nservices, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers. \nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products \nrequire significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant \nmarket power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable \ncompanies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers \nhave taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user \naccess to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our \nofferings, by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing our competitors \npreferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet \naccess providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. For \nexample, in 2018 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could permit \ninternet access providers to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services. In \naddition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or \nblockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, advertisers, and/or \ncontent providers, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby \nnegatively affecting our business. \nRisks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies \nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could \nharm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue \nto expand our business. \nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects, and our \nintroduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws \nand regulations. In recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new \nlaws and regulations relevant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and security, competition, \nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) requirements, AI, and online content. The costs of compliance with these \nmeasures are high and are likely to increase in the future. \nNew or changing laws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a \nmanner inconsistent with our practices, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, less useful products and \nservices, altered business practices, limited ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and \nservices, substantial costs, and civil or criminal liability. Examples include laws and regulations regarding: \n•\nCompetition and technology platforms’ business practices: Laws and regulations focused on large \ntechnology platforms, including the Digital Markets Act in the European Union (EU); regulations and legal \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n18.  \n\nsettlements in the U.S., South Korea, and elsewhere that affect Google Play’s billing policies, fees, and \nbusiness model; as well as litigation and new regulations under consideration in a range of jurisdictions.\n•\nAI: Laws and regulations focused on the development, use, and provision of AI technologies and other digital \nproducts and services, which could result in monetary penalties or other regulatory actions. For example, while \nlegislative text has yet to be finalized and formally approved, provisional political agreement on a proposed EU \nAI Act was reached between co-legislators in December 2023, including that specific transparency and other \nrequirements would be introduced for general purpose AI systems and the models on which those systems are \nbased. In addition, the White House's Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and \nUse of Artificial Intelligence devises a framework for the U.S. government, among other things, to regulate \nprivate sector use and development of certain foundation models. \n•\nData privacy, collection, and processing: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, processing, \nand/or sharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws; laws affecting the \nprocessing of children's data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws, and laws limiting data \ntransfers (including data localization laws). \n•\nCopyright and other intellectual property: Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on \nCopyright in the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which may introduce new \nlicensing regimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms, \nor create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers, \nwhich may result in other regulatory actions. \n•\nContent moderation: Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure \nobligations, such as the EU's Digital Services Act, Florida’s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas’ House Bill 20, and \nlaws and proposed legislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure \nto remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and \nalgorithms, which may make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with \nlow-quality, deceptive, or harmful content.\n•\nConsumer protection: Consumer protection laws, including the EU’s New Deal for Consumers, which could \nresult in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations, as interpreted by courts, \nregulators, or administrative bodies, remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For \nexample, we rely on statutory safe harbors, like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 \nof the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, to protect against liability for \nvarious linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and hosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe \nharbors may adversely affect us and may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals \nand pending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for \nwebsites and online platforms. Our development, use, and commercialization of AI products and services (including \nour implementation of AI in our offerings and internal systems) could subject us to regulatory action and legal liability, \nincluding under specific legislation regulating AI, as well as new applications of existing data protection, cybersecurity, \nprivacy, intellectual property, and other laws.\nWe are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, \nenforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability that could harm \nour business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and orders \ninvolving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and \nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or \npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters. We are also subject to a variety of claims including \nproduct warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation, \nand we may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental \neffects, AI training, development, and commercialization, or service disruptions or failures. Claims have been brought, \nand we expect will continue to be brought, against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright and \ntrademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, torts, privacy rights violations, fraud, or other legal \ntheories based on the nature and content of information available on or via our services, the design and effect of our \nproducts and services, or due to our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to \ncontent created by third parties. \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n19.  \n\nFor example, in December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google \nviolated antitrust laws related to Google Play's billing practices. The presiding judge will determine remedies in 2024 \nand the range of potential remedies vary widely. We plan to appeal. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice, \nvarious U.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business, \nincluding our advertising technologies and practices, the operation and distribution of Google Search, and the \noperation and distribution of the Android operating system and Play Store. Other regulatory agencies in the U.S. and \naround the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection agencies, and data protection authorities, have \nchallenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. We are \ncooperating with these investigations and defending litigation or appealing decisions where appropriate. \nVarious laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have involved in the past, \nand may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing \nobligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, including \ndivestiture, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, \nreputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nAny of these legal proceedings could result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity \nand other harms to our business. Estimating liabilities for our pending proceedings is a complex, fact-specific, and \nspeculative process that requires significant judgment, and the amounts we are ultimately liable for may be less than or \nexceed our estimates. The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, \nadditional substantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, reputation, \nfinancial condition, and operating results. \nFor additional information about the ongoing material legal proceedings to which we are subject, see Legal \nProceedings in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPrivacy, data protection, and data usage regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Any failure \nor alleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and \noperating results. \nAuthorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals \nconcerning data protection, data usage, and encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation \nhave resulted in, and may continue to result in, fines and orders requiring that we change our practices, which have \nhad and could continue to have an adverse effect on how we provide services, harming our business, reputation, \nfinancial condition, and operating results. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and \ncompliance obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs or harm the quality and operations of our products \nand services in ways that harm our business. Examples of these laws include: \n•\nThe General Data Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulations, which \napply to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or the United Kingdom, respectively, or \nrelated to products and services that we offer to EU or the United Kingdom users or customers, respectively, or \nthe monitoring of their behavior in the EU or the UK, respectively.\n•\nVarious comprehensive U.S. state and foreign privacy laws, which give new data privacy rights to their \nrespective residents (including, in California, a private right of action in the event of a data breach resulting \nfrom our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices) and impose \nsignificant obligations on controllers and processors of consumer data.\n•\nState laws governing the processing of biometric information, such as the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy \nAct and the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act, which impose obligations on businesses that \ncollect or disclose consumer biometric information. \n•\nVarious federal, state, and foreign laws governing how companies provide age appropriate experiences to \nchildren and minors, including the collection and processing of children and minor’s data. These include the \nChildren’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, and the United Kingdom Age-Appropriate Design Code, all of \nwhich address the use and disclosure of the personal data of children and minors and impose obligations on \nonline services or products directed to or likely to be accessed by children. \n•\nThe California Internet of Things Security Law, which regulates the security of data used in connection with \ninternet-connected devices.\n•\nThe EU’s Digital Markets Act, which will require in-scope companies to obtain user consent for combining data \nacross certain products and require search engines to share anonymized data with rival companies, among \nother changes. \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n20.  \n\nFurther, we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances \nwe can transfer, process and/or receive personal data, as well as ongoing enforcement actions from supervisory \nauthorities related to cross-border transfers of personal data. The validity of various data transfer mechanisms we \ncurrently rely upon remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments in both Europe and the U.S., which \nmay require us to adapt our existing arrangements.\nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend, \nresult in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to \nuse certain technologies. \nWe, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations \nof infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and \ntrademarks. Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts \nand the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-\nholding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims \nagainst us. As we continue to expand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased \nand may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies. \nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing \nagreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or \nelsewhere, including by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain \njurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues \nfor us and otherwise harm our business. \nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend \nagainst certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual \nproperty infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or \nsignificant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also \ndiscontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could \nresult in loss of revenues and harm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our \nsuppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from \nintellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in \nthe future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual \nproperty claims. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to \nlitigate or settle. To the extent such claims are successful, they could harm our business, including our product and \nservice offerings, financial condition, and operating results. \nExpectations relating to ESG considerations could expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, and \nreputational harm. \nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and other measures that govern a wide range of topics, including those \nrelated to matters beyond our core products and services. For instance, new laws, regulations, policies, and \ninternational accords relating to ESG matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are \nbeing developed and formalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may entail specific, target-driven \nframeworks and/or disclosure requirements. We have implemented robust ESG programs, adopted reporting \nframeworks and principles, and announced a number of goals and initiatives. The implementation of these goals and \ninitiatives may require considerable investments, and our goals, with all of their contingencies, dependencies, and in \ncertain cases, reliance on third-party verification and/or performance, are complex and ambitious, and may change. \nWe cannot guarantee that our goals and initiatives will be fully realized on the timelines we expect or at all, and \nprojects that are completed as planned may not achieve the results we anticipate. Any failure, or perceived failure, by \nus to adhere to our public statements, comply fully with developing interpretations of ESG laws and regulations, or \nmeet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could harm our business, reputation, financial \ncondition, and operating results.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or \nexposure to additional tax liabilities. \nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. \nOur effective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with \ndifferent statutory tax rates, net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk \nmanagement program, changes in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation, changes in the \nvaluation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax \nlaws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws). Further, if we are \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n21.  \n\nunable or fail to collect taxes on behalf of customers, employees and partners as the withholding agent, we could \nbecome liable for taxes that are levied against third parties. \nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have \nreceived, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such \nas transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit \ncould harm our financial condition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject \nus to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income \ntaxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. Although we believe our \nestimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements \nand may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. \nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions \nmay be subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. For \nexample, various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital \nservices taxes and other targeted taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax \nregimes. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is coordinating negotiations among \nmore than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies, \nincluding the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%. Our effective tax rate and cash tax \npayments could increase in future years as a result of these changes.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock \nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-\nterm stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could \ndiminish our cash reserves. \nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with \nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and \ndoes not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. \nFurther, our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves \nand may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock. \nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters. \nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has \nno voting rights. As of December 31, 2023, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 86.5% of our \noutstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 51.5% of the voting power of our outstanding common \nstock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring \nstockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or \nother sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no \nvoting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based \nacquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey’s current \nrelative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters \nsubmitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also \naffect Larry and Sergey’s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’ \nability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, \nwhich could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock. \nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that \nstockholders may consider favorable. \nProvisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a \nchange of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following: \n•\nOur Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of \nDirectors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director.\n•\nOur stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding \na stockholders' meeting.\n•\nOur certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of \nminority stockholders to elect director candidates.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n22.  \n\n•\nStockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to \npropose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter \na potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or \notherwise attempting to obtain control of our company. \n•\nOur Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, \nwhich makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or \npreferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us. \nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware \nlaw, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting \nstock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved \nthe transaction. Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us. \nThe trading price for our Class A stock and non-voting Class C stock may continue to be volatile. \nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In \naddition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have \nfluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, \nincluding, among others, the activities of our peers and changes in broader economic and political conditions around \nthe world. These broad market and industry factors could harm the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C \nstock, regardless of our actual operating performance. \nGeneral Risks \nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our \nresults to fall short of expectations. \nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future fluctuate, as a result of a number of factors, many \noutside of our control, including the cyclical nature and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events. As a result, \ncomparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis \nmay not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. \nConsequently, our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. \nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, \nand other consequences that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy \nand use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect \nto continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic arrangements, \nwhich could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include: \n•\ndiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and \nother strategic arrangements; \n•\nfailure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions \nplaced upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or \notherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction;\n•\nfailure to successfully integrate the acquired operations, technologies, services, and personnel (including \ncultural integration and retention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology; \n•\nimplementation of controls (or remediation of control deficiencies), procedures, and policies at the acquired \ncompany; \n•\nintegration of the acquired company’s accounting and other administrative systems, and the coordination of \nproduct, engineering, and sales and marketing functions;\n•\ntransition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;\n•\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages \nand to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific \ncountries; \n•\nfailure to accomplish commercial, strategic or financial objectives with respect to investments, joint ventures, \nand other strategic arrangements;\n•\nfailure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity;\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n23.  \n\n•\nliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark \ninfringement claims, data privacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, \nwarranty claims, product liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n•\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated \nemployees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions \nand other strategic arrangements could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated \nliabilities, and harm our business generally. \nOur acquisitions and other strategic arrangements could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, \nthe incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased \nlong-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results. \nAlso, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic arrangements may not materialize. In \nconnection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain \npotential liabilities, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. \nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire \nqualified personnel, or maintain and continue to adapt our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow or \noperate effectively. \nOur performance and future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key technical leads as \nwell as members of our senior management team. For instance, Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of \nAlphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of our technology, maintaining our \nculture, and setting our strategic direction. \nOur ability to compete effectively and our future success depend on our continuing to identify, hire, develop, \nmotivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified \nemployees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted, and may continue to target, our \nemployees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be \nsuccessful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Restrictive immigration \npolicy and regulatory changes may also affect our ability to hire, mobilize, or retain some of our global talent. All of our \nexecutive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance \npolicies.\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization \ngrows and evolves, we may need to adapt our corporate culture and work environments to ever-changing \ncircumstances, such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, and these changes could affect our ability to \ncompete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate culture. Under our hybrid work models, we may \nexperience increased costs and/or disruption, in addition to potential effects on our ability to operate effectively and \nmaintain our corporate culture. \nITEM 1B.\nUNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 1C.  CYBERSECURITY\nWe maintain a comprehensive process for identifying, assessing, and managing material risks from cybersecurity \nthreats as part of our broader risk management system and processes. We obtain input, as appropriate, for our \ncybersecurity risk management program on the security industry and threat trends from multiple external experts and \ninternal threat intelligence teams. Teams of dedicated privacy, safety, and security professionals oversee cybersecurity \nrisk management and mitigation, incident prevention, detection, and remediation. Leadership for these teams are \nprofessionals with deep cybersecurity expertise across multiple industries, including our Vice President of Privacy, \nSafety, and Security Engineering. Our executive leadership team, along with input from the above teams, are \nresponsible for our overall enterprise risk management system and processes and regularly consider cybersecurity \nrisks in the context of other material risks to the company.\nAs part of our cybersecurity risk management system, our incident management teams track and log privacy and \nsecurity incidents across Alphabet, our vendors, and other third-party service providers to remediate and resolve any \nsuch incidents. Significant incidents are reviewed regularly by a cross-functional working group to determine whether \nfurther escalation is appropriate. Any incident assessed as potentially being or potentially becoming material is \nimmediately escalated for further assessment, and then reported to designated members of our senior management. \nWe consult with outside counsel as appropriate, including on materiality analysis and disclosure matters, and our \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n24.  \n\nsenior management makes the final materiality determinations and disclosure and other compliance decisions. Our \nmanagement apprises Alphabet’s independent public accounting firm of matters and any relevant developments.\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee has oversight responsibility for risks and incidents relating to cybersecurity \nthreats, including compliance with disclosure requirements, cooperation with law enforcement, and related effects on \nfinancial and other risks, and it reports any findings and recommendations, as appropriate, to the full Board for \nconsideration. Senior management regularly discusses cyber risks and trends and, should they arise, any material \nincidents with the Audit and Compliance Committee. Internal Audit maintains a dedicated cybersecurity auditing team \nthat independently tests our cybersecurity controls. \nOur business strategy, results of operations and financial condition have not been materially affected by risks from \ncybersecurity threats, including as a result of previously identified cybersecurity incidents, but we cannot provide \nassurance that they will not be materially affected in the future by such risks or any future material incidents. For more \ninformation on our cybersecurity related risks, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES\nOur headquarters are located in Mountain View, California. We own and lease office facilities and data centers \naround the world, primarily in Asia, Europe, and North America. We believe our existing facilities are in good condition \nand suitable for the conduct of our business.\nITEM 3.\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFor a description of our material pending legal proceedings, see Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to \nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is \nincorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 4.\nMINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II\nITEM 5.\nMARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND \nISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nAs of October 2, 2015, Alphabet Inc. became the successor issuer of Google Inc. pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under \nthe Exchange Act. Our Class A stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG” \nsince August 19, 2004, and under the symbol \"GOOGL\" since April 3, 2014. Prior to August 19, 2004, there was no \npublic market for our stock. Our Class B stock is neither listed nor traded. Our Class C stock has been listed on the \nNasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG” since April 3, 2014.\nHolders of Record\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were approximately 7,305 and 1,757 stockholders of record of our Class A stock \nand Class C stock, respectively. Because many of our shares of Class A stock and Class C stock are held by brokers \nand other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders \nrepresented by these record holders. As of December 31, 2023, there were approximately 59 stockholders of record of \nour Class B stock.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common or capital stock. The primary use of capital \ncontinues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, \nincluding the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n25.  \n\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe following table presents information with respect to Alphabet's repurchases of Class A and Class C stock \nduring the quarter ended December 31, 2023: \nPeriod\nTotal Number of \nClass A Shares \nPurchased \n(in thousands)(1)\nTotal Number of \nClass C Shares \nPurchased \n(in thousands)(1)\nAverage Price \nPaid per \nClass A \nShare(2)\nAverage Price \nPaid per \nClass C \nShare(2)\nTotal Number of \nShares \nPurchased as \nPart of Publicly \nAnnounced \nPrograms\n(in thousands)(1)\nApproximate \nDollar Value of \nShares that May \nYet Be Purchased \nUnder the \nProgram \n(in millions)\nOctober 1 - 31\n \n9,923  \n38,687 $ \n134.66 $ \n135.65  \n48,610 $ \n45,736 \nNovember 1 - 30\n \n9,197  \n28,198 $ \n134.53 $ \n135.16  \n37,395 $ \n40,725 \nDecember 1 - 31\n \n7,502  \n24,760 $ \n135.76 $ \n136.37  \n32,262 $ \n36,347 \nTotal\n \n26,622  \n91,645 \n \n118,267 \n(1) \nRepurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment \nopportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans.

Discussion of 2022 results \ncompared to 2021 results to the extent not included in this report can be found in Item 7 of our 2022 Annual Report on \nForm 10-K.\nUnderstanding Alphabet’s Financial Results\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, \nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For \nadditional information on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 Business and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated \nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate \nthat they will continue to affect our future results:\n•\nUsers' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\nThe continuing evolution of the online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since \ninception. We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower \npace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our advertising revenues during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, which may \naffect our revenues.\n•\nUsers continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which \nallows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\nOur users are accessing our products and services via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, \nwearables, connected TVs, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or \nwhat they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to \nmaintain and grow our business.\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising \nformats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional \ndesktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues \nmay be affected. For example, changing dynamics within the global smartphone market, such as increased market \nsaturation in developed countries, can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow \nand TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic \nmix; partner agreement terms; partner mix; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product \nmix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\n•\nAs online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our \nmonetization.\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to \nexpand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. For example, \nrevenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also \nexpect to continue to incorporate AI innovations into our products, such as AI in Search, that could affect our \nmonetization trends. When developing new products and services we generally focus first on user experience and then \non monetization.\n•\nAs users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets \ncontinue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange \nrates affect such revenues. \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n29.  \n\nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., \nincluding in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our \nproducts and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased \nrevenues from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these \nmarkets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as \ndeveloping markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign \ncurrency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program \ndesigned to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues \nand earnings.\n•\nThe revenues that we derive beyond advertising are increasing and may adversely affect our margins.\nRevenues from cloud, consumer subscriptions, platforms, and devices, which may have differing characteristics \nthan our advertising revenues, have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding \nour products and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins \non our advertising revenues. For example, sales of our devices  adversely affect our consolidated margins due to \npressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.\n•\nAs we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and \ncapital expenditures.\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to \ndevelop new, innovative offerings, improve our existing offerings, and rapidly and responsibly deploy AI across our \nbusinesses. We also expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including \nservers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in \nparticular in support of AI products and services. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the \nbreadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and build strong \npartnerships around strategic initiatives.\n•\nWe continue to face an evolving regulatory environment, and we are subject to claims, lawsuits, \ninvestigations, and other forms of potential legal liability, which could affect our business practices and \nfinancial results.\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide \nrange of topics and related legal matters, including investigations, lawsuits, and regulatory actions, have resulted in \nfines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may \nincrease, our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we \nmay need to change our business practices to comply with evolving regulatory and legal matters. Examples include the \nantitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General; legislative \nproposals and pending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor \nprotection for websites and online platforms; and the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in Europe and various \nlegislative proposals in the U.S. focused on large technology platforms. For additional information, see Item 1A Risk \nFactors and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of \nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n•\nOur employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue \nhiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional \ninformation, see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide \nenterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration \ntools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and devices; and fees received for \nconsumer subscription-based products. For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed above, fluctuations in our \nrevenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by a combination of general factors, including:\n•\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n30.  \n\n•\nchanges in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives;\n•\ngeneral economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and \nother measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; \n•\nnew product and service launches; and\n•\nseasonality.\nAdditionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (\"Google advertising\"), revenues from other \nsources (\"Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues\"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues have \nbeen, and may continue to be, affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.\nGoogle Services\nGoogle Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices \nrevenues.\nGoogle Advertising\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following: \n•\nGoogle Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues \nfrom traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, \ntoolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n•\nYouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\n•\nGoogle Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, \nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nWe use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our \nadvertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while \nimpressions and cost-per-impression pertain to traffic on our Google Network properties.\nPaid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search \nproperties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play. Cost-\nper-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average \namount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in \nAdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based \nrevenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for \neach impression displayed to users. \nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, \nand counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by \nthe corresponding click and impression activity.\nFluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search \n& other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the \ncorrelation between these items have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general \nfactors described above, such as:\n•\nadvertiser competition for keywords;\n•\nchanges in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;\n•\nchanges in device mix; \n•\nseasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as \ntraditional retail seasonality; and\n•\ntraffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and \nchannels.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n31.  \n\nGoogle Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues are comprised of the following:\n•\nconsumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such YouTube TV, YouTube \nMusic and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\n•\nplatforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases;\n•\ndevices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\n•\nother products and services.\nFluctuations in our Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues have been, and may continue to be, \naffected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and \ndemand, number of subscribers, and fluctuations in the timing of product launches.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:\n•\nGoogle Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, \nplatform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity, databases, \nanalytics, and AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Duet AI for Google Cloud;\n•\nGoogle Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for \nenterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Duet AI in Google \nWorkspace; and\n•\nother enterprise services.\nFluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to \nthe general factors described above, such as customer usage.\nOther Bets\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet \nservices.\nCosts and Expenses \nOur cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses \ninclude costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and \nexpenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our \noperating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, \nfluctuations in compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, in particular due to \nannual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally vest over four years. \nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n•\nTAC includes: \n◦\namounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. \nOur distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, \nand software developers; and\n◦\namounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n•\nOther cost of revenues primarily includes:\n◦\ncompensation expense related to our data centers and other operations such as content review and \ncustomer and product support;\n◦\ncontent acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and \nother content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers \nbased on revenues generated or a flat fee);\n◦\ndepreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure; and\n◦\ninventory and other costs related to the devices we sell.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n32.  \n\nTAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly \nhigher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, \nbecause most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our \nGoogle Network partners.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either \nR&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.\nThe main components of our R&D expenses are:\n•\ncompensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing \nand new products and services; \n•\ndepreciation; and\n•\nthird-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering \nand product development efforts.\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\n•\ncompensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer \nservice functions; and\n•\nspending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\n•\ncompensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other \nadministrative support functions; \n•\nexpenses relating to legal matters, including certain fines and settlements; and \n•\nthird-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative \nservices.\nOther Income (Expense), Net \nOI&E, net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains (losses), \nnet gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, and income \n(loss) and impairment from our equity method investments. \nFor additional information, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in \nthe value of our investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \nPart II, Item 8 as well as Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this Annual Report on \nForm 10-K.\nProvision for Income Taxes \nProvision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred \nin the U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate.

The increase in compensation expenses included \ncharges related to employee severance associated with the reduction in our workforce. Additionally, cost of \nrevenues benefited from a reduction in depreciation due to the change in estimated useful lives of our servers \nand network equipment.\n•\nOperating expenses were $89.8 billion, an increase of 10% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in \ncompensation expenses and charges related to our office space optimization efforts. The increase in \ncompensation expenses was largely the result of charges related to employee severance associated with the \nreduction in our workforce and an increase in SBC expense. Operating expenses benefited from the change in \nthe estimated useful lives of our servers and certain network equipment.\nOther Information:\n•\nIn January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce, and as a result we recorded employee \nseverance and related charges of $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, we are \ntaking actions to optimize our global office space. As a result, exit charges recorded during the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023, were $1.8 billion. In addition to these exit charges, for the year ended December 31, \n2023, we incurred $269 million in accelerated rent and accelerated depreciation. For additional information, \nsee Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on \nForm 10-K.\n•\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment, \nresulting in a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years. \nThe effect of this change was a reduction in depreciation expense of $3.9 billion for the year ended December \n31, 2023, recognized primarily in cost of revenues and R&D expenses.

The overall growth was driven by \ninterrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage on mobile \ndevices; growth in advertiser spending; and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery.\nYouTube ads\nYouTube ads revenues increased $2.3 billion from 2022 to 2023. The growth was driven by our brand and direct \nresponse advertising products, both of which benefited from increased spending by our advertisers.\nGoogle Network\nGoogle Network revenues decreased $1.5 billion from 2022 to 2023, primarily driven by a decrease in Google Ad \nManager and AdSense revenues.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n35.  \n\nMonetization Metrics\nThe following table presents changes in monetization metrics for Google Search & other revenues (paid clicks \nand cost-per-click) and Google Network revenues (impressions and cost-per-impression), expressed as a percentage, \nfrom 2022 to 2023:\nGoogle Search & other\nPaid clicks change\n 7 %\nCost-per-click change\n 1 %\nGoogle Network\nImpressions change\n (5) %\nCost-per-impression change\n 0 %\nChanges in paid clicks and impressions are driven by a number of interrelated factors, including changes in \nadvertiser spending; ongoing product and policy changes; and, as it relates to paid clicks, fluctuations in search \nqueries resulting from changes in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices.\nChanges in cost-per-click and cost-per-impression are driven by a number of interrelated factors including \nchanges in device mix, geographic mix, advertiser spending, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, \nproperty mix, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues increased $5.6 billion from 2022 to 2023 primarily driven \nby growth in subscriptions, largely for YouTube services. The growth in YouTube services was primarily due to an \nincrease in paid subscribers.\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues increased $1.0 billion from 2021 to 2022 primarily driven \nby growth in subscription and device revenues, partially offset by a decrease in platform revenues. The growth in \nsubscriptions was largely for YouTube services, primarily due to an increase in paid subscribers. The growth in device \nrevenues was primarily driven by increased sales of Pixel devices. The decrease in platform revenues was primarily \ndue to Google Play, driven by the fee structure changes we announced in 2021 as well as a decrease in buyer \nspending. Additionally, the overall increase in Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues was adversely \naffected by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle Cloud revenues increased $6.8 billion from 2022 to 2023. Growth was primarily driven by Google Cloud \nPlatform followed by Google Workspace offerings. Google Cloud's infrastructure and platform services were the largest \ndrivers of growth in Google Cloud Platform.\nRevenues by Geography\nThe following table presents revenues by geography as a percentage of revenues, determined based on the \naddresses of our customers:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2022\n2023\nUnited States\n 48 %\n 47 %\nEMEA\n 29 %\n 30 %\nAPAC\n 16 %\n 17 %\nOther Americas\n 6 %\n 6 %\nHedging gains (losses)\n 1 %\n 0 %\nFor additional information, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n36.  \n\nUse of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information\nInternational revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple \ncurrencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period \ncomparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP \npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial \nand operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the \npresentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles \n(GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign \ncurrency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant \nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency \nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. \nWe use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year \nbasis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable \nperiod exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period \nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated \nusing prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with \nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures \nused by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents the foreign currency exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues (in \nmillions, except percentages):\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\n% Change from Prior Period\nYear Ended December 31,\nLess FX \nEffect\nConstant \nCurrency \nRevenues\nAs \nReported\nLess \nHedging \nEffect\nLess FX \nEffect\nConstant \nCurrency \nRevenues\n2022\n2023\nUnited States\n$ \n134,814 \n$ \n146,286 \n$ \n0 \n$ 146,286 \n 9 %\n 0 %\n 9 %\nEMEA\n \n82,062 \n \n91,038 \n \n460 \n \n90,578 \n 11 %\n 1 %\n 10 %\nAPAC\n \n47,024 \n \n51,514 \n \n(1,759)  \n53,273 \n 10 %\n (3) %\n 13 %\nOther Americas\n \n16,976 \n \n18,320 \n \n(654)  \n18,974 \n 8 %\n (4) %\n 12 %\nRevenues, excluding hedging effect  \n280,876 \n \n307,158 \n \n(1,953)  \n309,111 \n 9 %\n (1) %\n 10 %\nHedging gains (losses)\n \n1,960 \n \n236 \nTotal revenues(1)\n$ \n282,836 \n$ \n307,394 \n$ 309,111 \n 9 %\n 0 %\n (1) %\n 10 %\n(1)\nTotal constant currency revenues of $309.1 billion for 2023 increased $28.2 billion compared to $280.9 billion in revenues, \nexcluding hedging effect, for 2022.\nEMEA revenue growth was favorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the \nU.S. dollar weakening relative to the Euro, partially offset by the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish lira.\nAPAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to \nthe U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.\nOther Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, \nprimarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n37.  \n\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of Revenues\nThe following table presents cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, except percentages):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2021\n2022\n2023\nTAC\n$ \n45,566 \n$ \n48,955 \n$ \n50,886 \nOther cost of revenues\n \n65,373 \n \n77,248 \n \n82,446 \nTotal cost of revenues\n$ \n110,939 \n$ \n126,203 \n$ \n133,332 \nTotal cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues\n 43 %\n 45 %\n 43 %\nCost of revenues increased $7.1 billion from 2022 to 2023 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC \nof $5.2 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.\nThe increase in TAC from 2022 to 2023 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, \nprimarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.8% to 21.4% from 2022 to \n2023 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The \nTAC rate on Google Search & other revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially \nconsistent from 2022 to 2023.\nThe increase in other cost of revenues from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition \ncosts, largely for YouTube, and compensation expenses, which included $479 million of charges related to employee \nseverance associated with the reduction in our workforce. Additionally, other cost of revenues benefited from a \nreduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives of our servers and network equipment.\nThe increase in other cost of revenues of $11.9 billion from 2021 to 2022 was primarily due to increases in device \ncosts, compensation expenses, depreciation, and equipment-related expenses.\nResearch and Development\nThe following table presents R&D expenses (in millions, except percentages):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2022\n2023\nResearch and development expenses\n$ \n39,500 \n$ \n45,427 \nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of revenues\n 14 %\n 15 %\nR&D expenses increased $5.9 billion from 2022 to 2023 primarily driven by an increase in compensation \nexpenses of $2.9 billion, $870 million in charges related to our office space optimization efforts, and an increase in \ndepreciation expense of $722 million. The $2.9 billion increase in compensation expenses was largely the result of a \n4% increase in average headcount, after adjusting for roles affected by the reduction in our workforce, and an increase \nin SBC expense. Additionally, the increase in compensation expenses included $848 million in employee severance \ncharges associated with the reduction in our workforce.

Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, \nnet payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from 2022 to 2023 due to an increase in repurchases of stock.\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and \nfinancing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and \nfinancing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\nWe make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets \nthrough purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our \nservices and products.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\n•\ntechnical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, \nstorage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to as \nour information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and\n•\noffice facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\").\nConstruction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been \nplaced in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from \nmonths to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple \nphases, where we acquire land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information technology \nassets.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n41.  \n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, we spent $31.5 billion and $32.3 billion on capital \nexpenditures, respectively. We expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure, \nincluding servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term \ninitiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences \nwhen the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For \nthe years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, our depreciation on property and equipment were $13.5 billion and \n$11.9 billion, respectively.  \nLeases \nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, we recognized total operating lease assets of $4.4 billion and \n$2.9 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, \nwhich had a weighted average remaining lease term of eight years, was $17.7 billion, of which $3.2 billion is short-\nterm. As of December 31, 2023, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future short-term and \nlong-term lease payments of $657 million and $3.3 billion, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance \nSheets. These leases will commence between 2024 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms of one to 25 years. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs) \nwere $3.7 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023. For additional information, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial \nStatements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinancing\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net \nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2023, we had no \ncommercial paper outstanding.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2024 and \n$6.0 billion expiring in April 2028. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using \ncertain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have \nbeen borrowed under the credit facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $12.9 billion \nwith short-term and long-term future interest payments of $214 million and $3.6 billion, respectively. For additional \ninformation, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on \nForm 10-K.\nWe primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure \nand devices we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then \nsupply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and devices. Certain of \nthese arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be \npresented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 8 of this Annual \nReport on Form 10-K.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring 2023 we repurchased and subsequently retired 528 million shares for $62.2 billion.\nIn April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 \nbillion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2023, $36.3 billion remains available for Class A and \nClass C share repurchases.\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nShares\nAmount\nShares\nAmount\nClass A share repurchases\n61\n$ \n6,719 \n78\n$ \n9,316 \nClass C share repurchases\n469\n \n52,577 \n450\n \n52,868 \nTotal share repurchases(1)\n530\n$ \n59,296 \n528\n$ \n62,184 \n(1)         Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases as of December 31, 2023.\nFor additional information, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of \nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n42.  \n\nEuropean Commission Fines\nIn 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European \ncompetition law and imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of \nJune 30, 2018), and €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the General \nCourt reduced the 2018 fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the European Court of \nJustice.\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities \non our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For \nadditional information, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual \nReport on Form 10-K.\nTaxes\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had income taxes payable of $4.2 billion, of which $2.1 billion was short-term, \nrelated to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). As \npermitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have \nlong-term taxes payable of $6.3 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2023.\nPurchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $45.9 \nbillion, of which $31.6 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain technical \ninfrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to \ncommitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory and network capacity. For those agreements \nwith variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as \nof December 31, 2023. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change based on the \nexpected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content licenses, see Note \n10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and \nenergy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar \ncommitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and \nare not readily determinable.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make \nestimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of \nuncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a \nmaterial effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from \nour estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable \nunder the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical \naccounting estimates with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.\nFor a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements, see Note 1 of the \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-\nmarketable equity securities. These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method (\"the \nmeasurement alternative\") and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments \nresulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments \nrequire quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs. \nAdjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and involve the use of \nestimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the \ncompanies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of \nimpairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market \napproach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount \nrates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n43.  \n\nWhen the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its \ncurrent fair value.\nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e. \nperformance fees. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may \nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use \nof unobservable inputs.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when \nother changes occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use \nand utilization of assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we \nexpect to benefit from the assets. \nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating \nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of \ncomparable and resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain \ntax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial \nopinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately \nreserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not \nbe different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such \ndifferences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination \nis made.\nThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the \nrelated net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns \nby the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of \nadverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for \nincome taxes.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and \nconsent orders involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and \nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or \npublishers using our platforms, personal injury consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these matters \ninclude speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe \nthat it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a \nloss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of \nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that \nhas been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make \nadjustments and changes to our disclosures. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the \nestimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an \nexposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment resulting \nin a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years. This change in \naccounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. For additional information, see Note 1 of the Notes to \nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n44.  \n\nITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, \nand equity investment risks. \nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. International revenues, as well as costs and expenses \ndenominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the \nU.S. dollar. As discussed below, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risk. Principal \ncurrencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen. For the \npurpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange \nrates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be \nexperienced.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities \ndenominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts \nreduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and \nliabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in OI&E, which are offset \nby the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets, liabilities, and \ncommitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have \nresulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $136 million and $503 million as of \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for \nthe years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a \ncombination of purchased and written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in \nforeign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option \ncontacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign \ncurrency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging \ncontracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate \nthese contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot \nrate changes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them \ninto revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur. \nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to \nour cash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion lower as of \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a \ncorresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency \nrisks related to investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency \ntranslation risk from our foreign operations.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI \nrelated to our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $903 million and $946 million \nlower as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to \noffset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and \nmaintain liquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities, \nmortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate \nderivatives. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and \nfloating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair \nmarket value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income \nthan predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to \ninterest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt \nsecurities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. We measure \nsecurities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until \nthe securities are sold, less any expected credit losses. \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n45.  \n\nWe use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value \nof our marketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for \nour investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with \n95% confidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of marketable debt securities as of December 31, \n2022 and 2023 are shown below (in millions):\n \nAs of December 31,\n12-Month Average \nAs of December 31,\n \n2022\n2023\n2022\n2023\nRisk category - interest rate\n$ \n256 $ \n296 $ \n198 $ \n271 \nActual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the \nsensitivity analyses performed as of December 31, 2022 and 2023 due to the inherent limitations associated with \npredicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is \nnot intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.\nEquity Investment Risk\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that \ncould substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are \ninvestments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily \ndeterminable market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and \nrepresent $5.2 billion and $6.0 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. A \nhypothetical adverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2023 balance would decrease the fair value of \nmarketable equity securities by $597 million. From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market \nprice risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for \nobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the \nmeasurement alternative). The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an \nindication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the \nearly stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are \ntypically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition, \nwhich could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. Valuations of our equity \ninvestments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and \nobservable transactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses. In addition, global economic conditions \ncould result in additional volatility. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on \nthe likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public \nofferings, acquisitions, private sales or other market events. Changes in the valuation of non-marketable equity \nsecurities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities. As of December 31, \n2022 and 2023, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the \nmeasurement alternative, was $28.5 billion and $28.8 billion, respectively. \nThe carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.7 billion as of \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, these investments \ncould be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.\nFor additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated \nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n46.  \n\nITEM 8.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nAlphabet Inc.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \nPage\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 42)\n48\nFinancial Statements:\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n51\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n52\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n53\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity\n54\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n55\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n56\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n47.  \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alphabet Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, \n2022 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash \nflows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial \nstatement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In \nour opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the \nCompany at December 31, 2022 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three \nyears in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria \nestablished in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the \nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated January 30, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion \nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an \nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with \nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal \nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material \nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material \nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to \nthose risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in \nthe financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates \nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our \naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial \nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to \naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, \nsubjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion \non the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter \nbelow, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n48.  \n\nLoss Contingencies \nDescription of \nthe Matter\nThe Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, \nother proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and \nsecurity, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content \ngenerated by its users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using their \nplatforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. As described in Note 10 to the \nconsolidated financial statements “Commitments and contingencies” such claims, lawsuits, \nregulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders could result in \nadverse consequences.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood, and the estimated amount, of a \nloss related to such matters. Auditing management’s accounting for and disclosure of loss \ncontingencies from these matters involved challenging and subjective auditor judgment in \nassessing the Company’s evaluation of the probability of a loss, and the estimated amount or \nrange of loss.\nHow We \nAddressed the \nMatter in Our \nAudit\nWe tested relevant controls over the identified risks associated with management’s accounting for \nand disclosure of these matters. This included controls over management’s assessment of the \nprobability of incurrence of a loss and whether the loss or range of loss was reasonably estimable \nand the development of related disclosures.\nOur audit procedures included gaining an understanding of previous rulings and the status of \nongoing lawsuits, reviewing letters addressing the matters from internal and external legal counsel, \nmeeting with internal legal counsel to discuss the allegations, and obtaining a representation letter \nfrom management on these matters. We also evaluated the Company’s disclosures in relation to \nthese matters.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1999.\nSan Jose, California\nJanuary 30, 2024\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n49.  \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Alphabet Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria \nestablished in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the \nTreadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Alphabet Inc. (the Company) maintained, \nin all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO \ncriteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \nStates) (PCAOB), the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated January 30, 2024 \nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its \nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying \nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the \nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with \nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal \nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was \nmaintained in all material respects. \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a \nmaterial weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on \nthe assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We \nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding \nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with \ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies \nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect

\n\nAlphabet Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August \n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became \nthe successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide \nenterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales \nof other products and services, such as fees received for consumer subscription-based products, apps and in-app \npurchases, and devices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated \nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and \nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. \nActual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our \nestimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; content licenses; contingent liabilities; fair values \nof financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among \nothers. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, \nand the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and \nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain \nnetwork equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal \nyear 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and those \nplaced in service during the year ended December 31, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in \ndepreciation expense of $3.9 billion and an increase in net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.24 per basic and $0.24 per \ndiluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and \nthe collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other \nsimilar taxes are excluded from revenues. \nAdvertising Revenues\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\n•\nGoogle Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners \nwho use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated \nproperties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n•\nYouTube properties; and\n•\nGoogle Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, \nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google \nDisplay & Video 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for \nperformance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues \nwhen the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on \na gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed \non Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n56.  \n\nand amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we \ncontrol the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to \nmonetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being \nprimarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\nGoogle Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues consist of revenues from:\n•\nconsumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such YouTube TV, YouTube \nMusic and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\n•\nplatforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases;\n•\ndevices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\n•\nother products and services.\nSubscription revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the subscription, primarily monthly. We report \nrevenues from Google Play app sales and in-app purchases on a net basis, because our performance obligation is to \nfacilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a service fee. \nGoogle Cloud Revenues\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\n•\nGoogle Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, \nplatform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity, databases, \nanalytics, and AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Duet AI for Google Cloud;\n•\nGoogle Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for \nenterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Duet AI in Google \nWorkspace; and\n•\nother enterprise services.\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract \nterms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when \nthe customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services \nprovided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and \nconsumes the benefits of the cloud services.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate \nrevenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine \nstandalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. \nWe estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We \nbelieve that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\nSales Commissions\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We \nrecognize an asset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year. \nThese costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n•\nTAC includes: \n◦\namounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. \nOur distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, \nand software developers; and\n◦\namounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n57.  \n\n•\nOther cost of revenues includes:\n◦\ncompensation expense related to our data centers and other operations such as content review and \ncustomer and product support;\n◦\ncontent acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and \nother content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers \nbased on revenues generated or a flat fee);\n◦\ndepreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure; and\n◦\ninventory and other costs related to the devices we sell.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software \ncomponent of products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. \nTechnological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs \nthat meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and \ncloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software \napplications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the \nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications \nwere not material for the periods presented.\nStock-based Compensation \nStock-based compensation (SBC) primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity \nclassified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense \nusing the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be \npaid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and \nthe income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nAdditionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include \nmarket conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies. PSUs and \ncertain awards granted by Other Bet companies are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite \nservice period. Certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value \nthrough settlement. The fair value of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity valuation of the \nrespective Other Bet company.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended \nDecember 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $7.9 billion, $9.2 \nbillion, and $8.7 billion, respectively.\nPerformance Fees\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain \ninvestments. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may \nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use \nof unobservable inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of OI&E.\nFair Value Measurements \nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a \nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that \nis determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and \nliabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based \non the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active \nmarkets.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n58.  \n\nLevel 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for \nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all \nsignificant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, \nthese models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based \nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of \nunobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate \nvaluation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models.\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, \nmarketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets \nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and \nliabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\nWe measure certain other instruments, including SBC awards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies, and \ncertain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. \nFinancial Instruments\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative \nfinancial instruments and accounts receivable.\nCredit Risks\nWe are subject to credit risk primarily from cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, derivative financial \ninstruments, including foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. We manage our credit risk exposure \nthrough timely assessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management. \nForeign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts \nreceivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. \nWe manage our credit risk exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the \namount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers.\nCash Equivalents\nWe invest excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-\nbacked securities, time deposits, and money market funds.\nMarketable Securities\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of \npurchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities \non our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable \ndebt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have \nclassified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus \nreward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective \nmaturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities \nwith maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated \nBalance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a \ncomponent of stockholders’ equity, except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded \nin OI&E. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value \nare recorded in OI&E. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a \nspecific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of OI&E.\nOur investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses, \nincluding unrealized, recognized in OI&E. We classify our marketable equity securities subject to long-term lock-up \nrestrictions beyond 12 months as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNon-Marketable Securities\nNon-marketable securities primarily consist of equity securities. We account for non-marketable equity securities \nthrough which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method. All \nother non-marketable equity securities that we hold are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative. \nUnder the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n59.  \n\nchanges resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the \nsame issuer. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are \nrecorded as a component of OI&E.\nNon-marketable securities that do not have effective contractual maturity dates are classified as other non-\ncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nSee Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments. \nAccounts Receivable\nOur payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or \nservices offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or \nservices and customers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. \nAdditionally, accounts receivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the \ncustomer.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts \nreceivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements \nof Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics \nexist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In \ndetermining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status \nand make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider \ncustomer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic \nconditions.\nOther\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also entered into \ncommercial arrangements at or near the same time. For these transactions, judgment is required in assessing the \nsubstance of the arrangements, including assessing whether the components of the arrangements should be \naccounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP, and determining the value of the components of \nthe arrangements, including the fair value of the investments. Additionally, if our investment in such companies \nbecomes impaired, any remaining performance obligations would be reassessed and may be reduced.\nImpairment of Investments\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment. \nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is \nestimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past \nevents, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to OI&E, \nnot to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If \nwe have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized \nloss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the \ncorresponding charge as a component of OI&E. \nFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment \nindicators exist by evaluating the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among \nother indicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair \nvalue by recording the corresponding charge as a component of OI&E. We prepare quantitative measurements of the \nfair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.\nInventory\nInventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is \ncomputed using the first-in, first-out method.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in \nwhich we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are \nthe primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most \nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n60.  \n\nor benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a \nVIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination \nof whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. \nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets, \nconstruction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices, \ndata centers, and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network \nequipment. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet \nbeen placed in service. \nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the \nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate. Land is not depreciated. \nWe depreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets generally \nover a period of six years for servers and network equipment. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter \nof the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation for buildings, information \ntechnology assets, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures commences once they are ready for our \nintended use.\nGoodwill\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We \nevaluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in \nreporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for \nimpairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be \nimpaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-\nlease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily \ninclude payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease \npayments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets \nand liabilities.\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the \nlease assets and liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and \npayments for maintenance and utilities.\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease \ncommencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our \nincremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental \nborrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, \nand in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to \nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the \nbase, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any \nprepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our \noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is \nincluded in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease \nliabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease \nterm.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review leases, property and equipment, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when \nevents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed \nat the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by \ncomparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n61.  \n\nto generate. If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is \nmeasured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. \nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes \npayable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of \nevents that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax \nassets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of future realization of our \ndeferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets \nwhen it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax \nassets when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the \nglobal intangible low tax Income provision as a current period expense.\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on \ntechnical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the \nfinancial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be \nrealized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to \nunrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the \npurchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, \nexcept for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The \nexcess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. \nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nForeign Currency\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange \nrates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for \nrevenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders’ \nequity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction \ncurrency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in OI&E.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update \n(ASU) 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280):Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" which expands \nannual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about \nsignificant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for \ninterim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential \neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax \nDisclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and \nincome taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption \npermitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on our financial \nstatement disclosures.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n62.  \n\nNote 2.

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future \nservices that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue \nrecognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms \nand when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as \nrevenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related \ndeferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts \nwith an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including \namounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, \nplatforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $4.5 billion, of which $2.4 billion was \nrecognized as revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNote 3.    Financial Instruments \nFair Value Measurements\nInvestments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n63.  \n\nand Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs \nthat are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.\nDebt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use \nquoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable \ninputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which \nchanges in fair value are recorded in OI&E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the \nunrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.\nThe following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities measured at fair value on \na recurring basis (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2022\nFair Value \nHierarchy\nAdjusted \nCost\nGross \nUnrealized \nGains\nGross \nUnrealized \nLosses\nFair Value\nCash and \nCash \nEquivalents\nMarketable \nSecurities\nFair value changes \nrecorded in other \ncomprehensive income\nTime deposits\nLevel 2\n$ \n5,297 \n$ \n0 \n$ \n0 \n$ \n5,297 \n$ \n5,293 $ \n4 \nGovernment bonds\nLevel 2\n41,036\n \n64 \n \n(2,045)  \n39,055 \n \n283  \n38,772 \nCorporate debt securities\nLevel 2\n28,578\n \n8 \n \n(1,569)  \n27,017 \n \n1  \n27,016 \nMortgage-backed and \nasset-backed securities\nLevel 2\n16,176\n \n5 \n \n(1,242)  \n14,939 \n \n0  \n14,939 \nTotal investments with \nfair value change \nreflected in other \ncomprehensive \nincome(1)\n$ \n91,087 \n$ \n77 \n$ \n(4,856) $ \n86,308 \n$ \n5,577 $ \n80,731 \nFair value adjustments \nrecorded in net income\nMoney market funds\nLevel 1\n$ \n7,234 \n$ \n7,234 $ \n0 \nCurrent marketable \nequity securities(2)\nLevel 1\n \n4,013 \n \n0  \n4,013 \nMutual funds\nLevel 2\n \n339 \n \n0  \n339 \nGovernment bonds\nLevel 2\n \n1,877 \n \n440  \n1,437 \nCorporate debt securities\nLevel 2\n \n3,744 \n \n65  \n3,679 \nMortgage-backed and \nasset-backed securities\nLevel 2\n \n1,686 \n \n2  \n1,684 \nTotal investments with \nfair value change \nrecorded in net \nincome\n$ \n18,893 \n$ \n7,741 $ \n11,152 \nCash\n \n0 \n \n8,561  \n0 \nTotal\n$ \n91,087 \n$ \n77 \n$ \n(4,856) $ \n105,201 \n$ \n21,879 $ \n91,883 \n(1)\nRepresents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to AOCI.\n(2)\nThe long-term portion of marketable equity securities (subject to long-term lock-up restrictions) of $803 million as of \nDecember 31, 2022 is included within other non-current assets.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n64.  \n\nAs of December 31, 2023\nFair Value \nHierarchy\nAdjusted \nCost\nGross \nUnrealized \nGains\nGross \nUnrealized \nLosses\nFair Value\nCash and \nCash \nEquivalents\nMarketable \nSecurities\nFair value changes \nrecorded in other \ncomprehensive income\nTime deposits\nLevel 2\n$ \n2,628 \n$ \n0 \n$ \n0 \n$ \n2,628 \n$ \n2,628 $ \n0 \nGovernment bonds\nLevel 2\n \n38,106 \n \n233 \n \n(679)  \n37,660 \n \n1,993  \n35,667 \nCorporate debt securities\nLevel 2\n \n22,457 \n \n112 \n \n(637)  \n21,932 \n \n0  \n21,932 \nMortgage-backed and \nasset-backed securities\nLevel 2\n \n17,243 \n \n88 \n \n(634)  \n16,697 \n \n0  \n16,697 \nTotal investments with \nfair value change \nreflected in other \ncomprehensive \nincome(1)\n$ \n80,434 \n$ \n433 \n$ \n(1,950) $ \n78,917 \n$ \n4,621 $ \n74,296 \nFair value adjustments \nrecorded in net income\nMoney market funds\nLevel 1\n$ \n6,480 \n$ \n6,480 $ \n0 \nCurrent marketable \nequity securities(2)\nLevel 1\n4,282\n \n0 \n4,282\nMutual funds\nLevel 2\n311\n \n0 \n311\nGovernment bonds\nLevel 2\n1,952\n \n347 \n1,605\nCorporate debt securities\nLevel 2\n3,782\n \n91 \n3,691\nMortgage-backed and \nasset-backed securities\nLevel 2\n2,683\n \n0 \n2,683\nTotal investments with \nfair value change \nrecorded in net \nincome\n$ \n19,490 \n$ \n6,918 $ \n12,572 \nCash\n \n0 \n \n12,509  \n0 \nTotal\n$ \n80,434 \n$ \n433 \n$ \n(1,950) $ \n98,407 \n$ \n24,048 $ \n86,868 \n(1)\nRepresents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to AOCI.\n(2)\nThe long-term portion of marketable equity securities (subject to long-term lock-up restrictions) of $1.4 billion as of \nDecember 31, 2023 is included within other non-current assets.\nInvestments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable \nmarket values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable \ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities \nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 \nin the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods, including option pricing models, \nmarket comparable approach, and common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the \nobservable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to \nexit, risk free rate, and the rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.

See Note 7 for further details on OI&E. \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n67.  \n\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk \nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, \nand investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We \nalso enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives \nprimarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a \ncombination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. \nThe accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge \ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have \nmaturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and \nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and \ntime value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the \nhedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the \namount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect \nwas $47 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our \nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the \nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related \nhedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the \nexcluded component in OI&E.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks \nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge \neffectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward \npoints from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&E.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to \nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the \nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting \nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and \nliabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, \ncommodity prices, credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into derivatives to \nhedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from other \nderivatives are primarily reflected within the “other” component of OI&E.

Variable Interest Entities \nConsolidated Variable Interest Entities\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of \noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. \n For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us. \nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $4.1 billion \nand $4.9 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.6 billion and \n$2.5 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other \nBets. \nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion as of \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively, of which $1.1 billion is redeemable noncontrolling interest (RNCI) for both \nperiods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests \nwas not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 7 for further \ndetails on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated Variable Interest Entities\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies \nthat are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power \ngeneration using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that \nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of \noperations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account \nfor these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the \ninvestments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these unconsolidated \nVIEs were $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and $5.7 billion and $4.0 billion, \nrespectively, as of December 31, 2023. The difference between the maximum exposure and the carrying value relates \nprimarily to future funding commitments.\nNote 6.

Workforce Reduction and Other Initiatives \nWe have a company-wide effort underway to re-engineer our cost base. As part of this program, in January 2023, \nwe announced a reduction of our workforce. As a result, total employee severance and related charges recorded \nduring the year ended December 31, 2023 were $2.1 billion. Substantially all of the employees affected were no longer \nincluded in our headcount as of December 31, 2023.\nIn addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As a result, exit charges recorded during the \nyear ended December 31, 2023, were $1.8 billion as reflected in the table below. In addition to these exit charges, for \nthe year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred $269 million in accelerated rent and accelerated depreciation, which \nare not included in the table below.\nSeverance and office space exit charges are included within our consolidated statements of income as follows (in \nmillions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nSeverance \nand Related (1)\nOffice Space\nTotal\nCost of revenues\n$ \n479 $ \n481 $ \n960 \nResearch and development\n848\n \n870  \n1,718 \nSales and marketing\n497\n \n257  \n754 \nGeneral and administrative\n264\n \n237  \n501 \nTotal charges\n$ \n2,088 $ \n1,845 $ \n3,933 \n(1)\nSeverance includes amounts to be settled in cash, accounted for as one-time involuntary employee termination benefits, and \nSBC.\nFor segment reporting, the substantial majority of these charges are included within Alphabet-level activities in our \nsegment results.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, changes in liabilities resulting from the severance charges and related \naccruals were as follows (in millions):\nSeverance and \nRelated\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n$ \n0 \nCharges(1)\n \n1,656 \nCash payments\n \n(1,579) \nBalance as of December 31, 2023(2)\n$ \n77 \n(1)\nExcludes non-cash SBC of $432 million.\n(2)\nIncluded in accrued compensation and benefits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n76.  \n\nNote 9.

Commitments and Contingencies \nCommitments\nWe have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $10.6 billion as \nof December 31, 2023, of which the majority is paid over seven years ending in the first quarter of 2030.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate \nactivities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, \ncustomers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed \nto defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or \nout of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit \nthe time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered \ninto indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification \nobligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification \nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the \npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, \ncash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future \npayments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows \nin a particular period. \nAs of December 31, 2023, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably \npossible.\nLegal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be \nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be \nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect \nthe amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses \ndisclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial \nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine \nboth the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be \nunable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are \ninherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in aggregate, have a \nmaterial adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n77.  \n\nAntitrust Investigations\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various \nantitrust-related complaints against us.\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and \nranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.4 \nbillion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General \nCourt, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the \nEC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. On November 10, \n2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice \non January 20, 2022.\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution \nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, \n2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and \non October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September 14, \n2022, the General Court reduced the fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the \nEuropean Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by \n$217 million in 2022.\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google \nhad with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5 \nbillion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, \nwhich we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision. We recognized a charge \nof $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition \nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. Examples, for which given their \nnature we cannot estimate a possible loss, include:\n•\nIn August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) \nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our \nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search \nand Search advertising. The trial ended on November 16, 2023, and we expect a decision in 2024. Further, in \nJune 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's \nCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\n•\nOn December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state \ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025. Additionally, \non January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint in \nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google’s digital advertising technology \nproducts violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional state Attorneys General \njoined the complaint. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's \nadvertising technology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively. \nOn June 14, 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that \nGoogle violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We responded to the SO on \nDecember 1, 2023.\n•\nOn July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for \nthe Northern District of California, alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. \nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement \nin principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated \nthe trial date with the states, and any final approval of the settlement is expected to occur in 2024. In May \n2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play’s business practices. Korean \nregulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, including a formal review in May 2022 of Google's \ncompliance with the new app store billing regulations. \nWe believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to \ncooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n78.  \n\nPrivacy Matters \nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of \nprivacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations and \nlitigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information and \nadvertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes. \nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that \ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these \nlawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders \npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change \nour business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for \nus and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly \nbecome an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can \nresult in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a \nprohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important \nproducts into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against \ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, \nand may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our \ncustomers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions \nor otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent \norders involving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, \ncommercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using \nour platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, in December 2023, a California \njury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play's \nbusiness. The presiding judge will determine remedies in 2024, and the range of potential remedies vary widely. We \nplan to appeal. We also periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. \nThese claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could \nresult in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our \nproducts and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other \nadverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding \npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including \nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The \nsubject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the \nsale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue \nnon-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when \na loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of \nloss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of \nthese matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our \nexpectations.\nSee, Note 14 for information regarding income tax contingencies.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n79.  \n\nNote 11.        Stockholders' Equity \nClass A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C \ncapital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect \nto voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock \nis entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law. \nShares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically \nconvert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\nShare Repurchases\nIn the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, we repurchased $50.3 billion, $59.3 billion, and \n$62.2 billion, respectively, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.\nIn April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional \n$70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2023, $36.3 billion remains available for Class A \nand Class C share repurchases. \nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nShares\nAmount\nShares\nAmount\nClass A share repurchases\n61\n$ \n6,719 \n78\n$ \n9,316 \nClass C share repurchases\n469\n \n52,577 \n450\n \n52,868 \nTotal share repurchases(1)\n530\n$ \n59,296 \n528\n$ \n62,184 \n(1)         Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases as of December 31, 2023.\nClass A and Class C shares are repurchased in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its \nstockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading \nprices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to \ngeneral business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or \nprivately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an \nexpiration date.\nNote 12.        Net Income Per Share \nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net \nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net \nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive \nsecurities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of RSUs and other contingently issuable \nshares. The dilutive effect of outstanding RSUs and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings \nper share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A \nstock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not \nassume the conversion of those shares.\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock \nare identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of \nincorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per \nshare dividends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to \nour certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a \ngiven class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In \naddition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it \nmust be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each \nyear are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A, Class B, and Class C stock as if the \nearnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed \nearnings are allocated on a proportionate basis. \nIn the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, the net income per share amounts are the same for \nClass A, Class B, and Class C stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or \ndistributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n80.  \n\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A, Class B, and \nClass C stock (in millions, except per share amounts):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2021\n \nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\nBasic net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings \n$ \n34,200 \n$ \n5,174 \n$ \n36,659 \nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n \n6,006 \n \n909 \n \n6,438 \nBasic net income per share\n$ \n5.69 \n$ \n5.69 \n$ \n5.69 \nDiluted net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation \n$ \n34,200 \n$ \n5,174 \n$ \n36,659 \nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A \nshares\n \n5,174 \n \n0 \n \n0 \nReallocation of undistributed earnings\n \n(581)  \n(77)  \n581 \nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$ \n38,793 \n$ \n5,097 \n$ \n37,240 \nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in basic computation\n \n6,006 \n \n909 \n \n6,438 \nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities\nAdd:\nConversion of Class B to Class A shares outstanding\n \n909 \n \n0 \n \n0 \nRestricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares\n \n0 \n \n0 \n \n200 \nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n \n6,915 \n \n909 \n \n6,638 \nDiluted net income per share\n$ \n5.61 \n$ \n5.61 \n$ \n5.61 \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2022\n \nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\nBasic net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$ \n27,518 \n$ \n4,072 \n$ \n28,382 \nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n \n5,994 \n \n887 \n \n6,182 \nBasic net income per share\n$ \n4.59 \n$ \n4.59 \n$ \n4.59 \nDiluted net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation \n$ \n27,518 \n$ \n4,072 \n$ \n28,382 \nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A \nshares\n \n4,072 \n \n0 \n \n0 \nReallocation of undistributed earnings\n \n(230)  \n(30)  \n230 \nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$ \n31,360 \n$ \n4,042 \n$ \n28,612 \nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in basic computation\n \n5,994 \n \n887 \n \n6,182 \nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities\nAdd:\nConversion of Class B to Class A shares outstanding\n \n887 \n \n0 \n \n0 \nRestricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares\n \n0 \n \n0 \n \n96 \nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n \n6,881 \n \n887 \n \n6,278 \nDiluted net income per share\n$ \n4.56 \n$ \n4.56 \n$ \n4.56 \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n81.  \n\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2023\n \nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\nBasic net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$ \n34,601 \n$ \n5,124 \n$ \n34,070 \nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n \n5,922 \n \n877 \n \n5,831 \nBasic net income per share\n$ \n5.84 \n$ \n5.84 \n$ \n5.84 \nDiluted net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation \n$ \n34,601 \n$ \n5,124 \n$ \n34,070 \nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A \nshares\n \n5,124 \n \n0 \n \n0 \nReallocation of undistributed earnings\n \n(287)  \n(37)  \n287 \nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$ \n39,438 \n$ \n5,087 \n$ \n34,357 \nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in basic computation\n \n5,922 \n \n877 \n \n5,831 \nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities\nAdd:\nConversion of Class B to Class A shares outstanding\n \n877 \n \n0 \n \n0 \nRestricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares\n \n0 \n \n0 \n \n92 \nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n \n6,799 \n \n877 \n \n5,923 \nDiluted net income per share\n$ \n5.80 \n$ \n5.80 \n$ \n5.80 \nNote 13.

Under our stock plans, RSUs and other types of awards may be granted. Under the \nAlphabet 2021 Stock Plan, an RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our Class C stock at the time the award \nvests. RSUs generally vest over four years contingent upon employment on the vesting date.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were 723 million shares of Class C stock reserved for future issuance under the \nAlphabet 2021 Stock Plan.\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, total SBC expense was $15.7 billion, $19.5 billion, and \n$22.1 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $15.0 billion, $18.8 \nbillion, and $21.7 billion, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, total SBC expense includes $432 million associated with workforce \nreduction costs. See Note 8 for further details.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, we recognized tax benefits on total SBC expense, \nwhich are reflected in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income, of $3.1 billion, $3.9 \nbillion, and $4.5 billion, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, tax benefit realized related to awards vested or \nexercised during the period was $5.9 billion, $4.7 billion, and $5.6 billion, respectively. These amounts do not include \nthe indirect effects of stock-based awards, which primarily relate to the R&D tax credit.\nStock-Based Award Activities\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n82.  \n\nThe following table summarizes the activities for unvested Alphabet RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2023 \n(in millions, except per share amounts):\nUnvested Restricted Stock Units\n \n    Number of    \nShares\nWeighted-\nAverage\nGrant-Date\nFair Value\nUnvested as of December 31, 2022\n \n324 $ \n107.98 \nGranted\n \n263 $ \n97.59 \nVested\n \n(217) $ \n100.36 \nForfeited/canceled\n \n(32) $ \n106.56 \nUnvested as of December 31, 2023\n \n338 $ \n104.93 \nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2021 and \n2022 was $97.46 and $127.22, respectively.

A cumulative one-time adjustment applicable to the prior period for \nthese tax rule changes was recorded in 2023.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets \nand liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components \nof our deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n2022\n2023\nDeferred tax assets:\nAccrued employee benefits\n$ \n955 $ \n1,855 \nAccruals and reserves not currently deductible\n \n1,956  \n2,481 \nTax credits\n \n6,002  \n6,609 \nNet operating losses\n \n2,557  \n2,965 \nOperating leases\n \n2,711  \n3,526 \nCapitalized research and development(1)\n \n10,381  \n17,757 \nOther\n \n2,289  \n1,951 \nTotal deferred tax assets\n \n26,851  \n37,144 \nValuation allowance\n \n(9,553)  \n(10,999) \nTotal deferred tax assets net of valuation allowance\n \n17,298  \n26,145 \nDeferred tax liabilities:\nProperty and equipment, net\n \n(6,607)  \n(8,189) \nNet investment gains\n \n(2,361)  \n(2,405) \nOperating leases\n \n(2,491)  \n(2,965) \nOther\n \n(1,092)  \n(902) \nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n \n(12,551)  \n(14,461) \nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities)\n$ \n4,747 $ \n11,684 \n(1)\nAs required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, effective January 1, 2022, our research and development expenditures were \ncapitalized and amortized which resulted in substantially higher cash taxes starting in 2022 with an equal amount of deferred \ntax benefit. \nAs of December 31, 2023, our federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax \npurposes were approximately $7.1 billion, $18.6 billion, and $1.8 billion respectively. If not utilized, the federal net \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n84.  \n\noperating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2024, foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in \n2025 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2029. It is more likely than not that the \nmajority of the net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized; therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance \nagainst them. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under the tax laws of the \ndifferent jurisdictions.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our Federal and California research and development credit carryforwards for income \ntax purposes were approximately $600 million and $6.3 billion, respectively. If not utilized, the Federal R&D credit will \nbegin to expire in 2037 and the California R&D credit can be carried over indefinitely. We believe the majority of the \nfederal tax credit and state tax credit is not likely to be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our investment tax credit carryforwards for state income tax purposes were \napproximately $1.0 billion and will begin to expire in 2029. We use the flow-through method of accounting for \ninvestment tax credits. We believe this tax credit is not likely to be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to California deferred tax assets, \ncertain federal net operating losses, certain state net operating losses and tax credits, net deferred tax assets relating \nto Other Bet companies, and certain foreign net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized. We \ncontinue to reassess the remaining valuation allowance quarterly, and if future evidence allows for a partial or full \nrelease of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly. \nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\n \n2021\n2022\n2023\nBeginning gross unrecognized tax benefits\n$ \n3,837 $ \n5,158 $ \n7,055 \nIncreases related to prior year tax positions\n \n529  \n253  \n740 \nDecreases related to prior year tax positions\n \n(263)  \n(437)  \n(682) \nDecreases related to settlement with tax authorities\n \n(329)  \n(140)  \n(21) \nIncreases related to current year tax positions\n \n1,384  \n2,221  \n2,346 \nEnding gross unrecognized tax benefits\n$ \n5,158 $ \n7,055 $ \n9,438 \nYear Ended December 31,\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating \nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax \nbenefits was $5.2 billion, $7.1 billion, and $9.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively, of which \n$3.7 billion, $5.3 billion, and $7.4 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively. \nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, we accrued $346 million and $622 million in interest and penalties in \nprovision for income taxes, respectively.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two \nmajor tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax \nreturns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2021 tax returns. We \nhave also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or \npermanent establishment. We continue to defend such claims as presented.\nThe tax years 2016 through 2022 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for \nIrish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial \nstatements.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the \nadequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax \nauthorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. \nHowever, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are \nresolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for \nincome taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is \nnot certain, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S. \ntax positions could decrease by approximately $700 million in the next 12 months. Positions that may be resolved \ninclude various U.S. and non-U.S. matters.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n85.  \n\nNote 15.        Information about Segments and Geographic Areas \nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n•\nGoogle Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps, \nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees \nreceived for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and \nNFL Sunday Ticket; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.\n•\nGoogle Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for \nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and \nsubscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and \ncollaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n•\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from \nOther Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering \nactivities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the \nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are \nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are \nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\nReflecting DeepMind's increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, beginning in \nthe first quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet-level activities instead of within Other Bets. \nAdditionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation methodologies to \nprovide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have been recast to \nconform to the current presentation.\nAs announced on April 20, 2023, we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind to \nsignificantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI). The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported within \nAlphabet-level activities prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the Brain team was \nincluded within Google Services.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs \nprimarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate \ninitiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and \nlegal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office \nspace during 2023 were not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not \nallocated to our segments.\nOur operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\nThe following table presents information about our segments (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021\n2022\n2023\nRevenues:\nGoogle Services\n$ \n237,529 $ \n253,528 $ \n272,543 \nGoogle Cloud\n \n19,206  \n26,280  \n33,088 \nOther Bets\n \n753  \n1,068  \n1,527 \nHedging gains (losses)\n \n149  \n1,960  \n236 \nTotal revenues\n$ \n257,637 $ \n282,836 $ \n307,394 \nOperating income (loss):\nGoogle Services\n$ \n88,132 $ \n82,699 $ \n95,858 \nGoogle Cloud\n \n(2,282)  \n(1,922)  \n1,716 \nOther Bets\n \n(4,051)  \n(4,636)  \n(4,095) \nAlphabet-level activities\n \n(3,085)  \n(1,299)  \n(9,186) \nTotal income from operations\n$ \n78,714 $ \n74,842 $ \n84,293 \nSee Note 2 for information relating to revenues by geography.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n86.  \n\nThe following table presents long-lived assets by geographic area, which includes property and equipment, net \nand operating lease assets (in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n \n2022\n2023\nLong-lived assets:\nUnited States\n$ \n93,565 $ \n110,053 \nInternational\n \n33,484  \n38,383 \nTotal long-lived assets\n$ \n127,049 $ \n148,436 \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n87.  \n\nITEM 9.\nCHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL \nDISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the \neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the \nend of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBased on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, \n2023, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to \nprovide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the \nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules \nand forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief \nexecutive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter \nended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal \ncontrol over financial reporting. \nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial \nreporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the \neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated \nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). \nBased on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of \nDecember 31, 2023. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit and Compliance Committee. \nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by Ernst & \nYoung LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls \nand procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the \ndesired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there \nare resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible \ncontrols and procedures relative to their costs.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n88.  \n\nITEM 9B.\nOTHER INFORMATION\n10b5-1 Trading Plans\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, the following Section 16 officer and directors adopted, \nmodified or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange \nAct):\n•\nJohn Hennessy, Chair of the Board of Directors, through the John L.

    "content": "To our investors,\n2022 was a year full of change and uncertainty around \nthe world. In February, when war broke out in Ukraine, \nour teams worked around-the-clock to make sure our \nproducts were helpful to people who needed them, from \nproviding trustworthy information on Search to disrupting \ncyberattacks to partnering with the government to deploy \nair raid alerts. In March, I traveled to Warsaw, Poland, \nwhere I met Googlers hosting families who sought refuge, \ntalked with entrepreneurs using our office spaces, and \nsaw how our products like Google Translate were helping \nUkrainians find a bit of hope and connection.\nBy late spring, the tech industry was adjusting to a \nmore challenging macroeconomic environment, and \nas a company we embarked on efforts to sharpen our \nfocus and make sure our efforts are aligned with our \nhighest priorities. Near the end of the year, AI reached \nan inflection point, made possible by our foundational \nbreakthroughs like Transformer and advances in diffusion \nmodels. It was an exciting moment for us after having \nworked to develop the technology responsibly for so \nmany years. And on December 18, during the World Cup \nfinal, Google Search saw its highest query-per-second \nvolume of all time, a strong signal of our momentum.\nThrough it all, we launched new products that helped us \nadvance our mission: to organize the world’s information \nand make it universally accessible and useful. Over the \npast few years, AI has emerged as the most important \nway we can advance our mission, and in 2022, we made \nsome of our biggest technological advancements yet.  \nIn the area of natural language understanding, our latest \nmodel, PaLM, demonstrates breakthrough capabilities \nin language, reasoning, and code tasks. Breakthroughs \nin “chain of thought” prompting are helping to build \nsystems that can perform multistep reasoning and break \ndown complex problems into smaller tasks. We also \nshared new generative models, including Imagen, our \ntext-to-image model, and Phenaki, which can generate \nlong, coherent videos from text prompts.\nIt’s been especially exciting to see how AI advancements \nare making our products more helpful. Last year, we \nlaunched multisearch, a new way to search using both \ntext and images, and it’s now available in more than  \n70 languages. People use Lens more than 10 billion  \ntimes per month to search with their camera or images,  \nand its new, AI-powered translation feature blends \ntranslated text seamlessly into the background of images. \nAnd, thanks to a new machine learning technique, we \nadded 24 new languages to Google Translate, including \nits first indigenous languages of the Americas.\nThe breakthroughs we’re seeing are poised to transform \nevery industry, and we’re helping businesses tap into the \nnew opportunities AI creates. Last year, we announced \nnew products to help businesses solve problems using \nAI, including Translation Hub, which can be used to \ntranslate documents into 135 languages at a previously \nunimaginable scale and speed. We brought more \nAI-powered features to Google Workspace, including \nautomatic summarization for Google Docs and Chat to \nhelp people get work done faster. To help advertisers \ncreate meaningful performance, last year we started \nincorporating large language models into broad match,  \na tool that makes it easier to match advertiser offers  \nto search queries.\nIn the first few months of 2023, we’ve continued to roll \nout new products and features that help unlock incredible \nopportunities for consumers, partners, and businesses, \nincluding ours. Among them, we introduced PaLM API,  \nan easy and safe way for developers to build on top of our \nlanguage models, and generative AI capabilities in Google \n→\n\n2\nContents\n4  \nDelivering products  \nbuilt to help \n12  \nBuilding trust  \nby building a safer \ndigital world\n \n16  \nHelping our  \ncustomers and partners \nevolve and grow\n \n19  \nOur commitments\n \n20  \nSupporting economic \nresilience for  \npeople, communities,  \nand businesses\n \n24  \nAdvancing equity  \nand inclusion\n \n28  \nTaking on the  \nclimate crisis\n \n31  \nOther Bets\n \nInside back cover  \nDirectors and  \nexecutive officers\nCloud and Workspace. We also launched Bard, an early \nexperiment for people to collaborate with generative AI. \nIt’s one way we are giving users direct access to large \nlanguage models, and part of a natural journey where \nwe’ll continue to iterate and make progress.\nAI is also helping us to find solutions to some of the \nworld’s biggest problems. We partnered with iCad to \nlicense our mammography technology for breast cancer \nscreenings, which is being used in clinics for the first \ntime. DeepMind’s AlphaFold database grew by orders  \nof magnitude, expanding from about one million to  \n200 million structures. One million researchers have \nused it around the world to help solve problems in \nsustainability, drug discovery, human biology, and more.\nBeyond AI, we’re excited about the continued momentum \nacross our businesses. Just a few examples: YouTube \nPremium is now up to 80 million paying subscribers and \ntrialers, an increase of 30 million from the year before. \nAnd YouTube Shorts is now averaging more than 50 billion \ndaily views. We introduced our newest lineup of Pixel \ndevices, and our Pixel 6a, Pixel 7, and Pixel 7 Pro are the \nbest-selling generation of phones we’ve ever launched. \nAnd we continue to open cloud regions and invest in data \ncenters around the world, including our first-ever data \ncenter in Japan.\nIn September, Google will turn 25. I am grateful to our \nemployees, partners, and shareholders everywhere who \nhave made this milestone possible, and look forward to \nwhat the next year – and quarter century – will bring.\nSundar Pichai \nCEO of Alphabet and Google\n\n3\nYear in Review 2022\nA year of agility and reinvention\n2022 was another year of profound change \nand challenge. As the world contended with \nconcurrent health, economic, social, and climate \nchallenges, learning how to adapt became the \nnew normal. At Google, we feel a responsibility \nto do our part, and do our best, by delivering \nproducts built to help. We strive every day to \nempower people, businesses, and communities \nwith technology that can help them navigate  \nour changing world.\n\n4\nOur mission to organize the world’s information and \nmake it universally accessible and useful remains \ncentral to how we build our products. In 2022,  \nwe worked to advance knowledge and computing, \ndrawing on AI to build products that are more \naccessible and helpful for everyone, everywhere.\nInformation is only as useful as it is easy to access, \nso we continued to make Search and YouTube as \nintuitive as possible. We launched multisearch, a \nway of searching with both images and text at the \nsame time using AI. With Google Lens, you can take \na photo of the tomato plant in front of you and add \n“care instructions” to quickly learn how to nurse the \nplant back to health. On YouTube, people are often \nsearching for a specific moment in a video, and with \nthe launch of auto-generated chapters, it’s easier  \nto jump straight to the point they need.\nDelivering products  \n built to help\n\n5\nYear in Review 2022\nMultisearch\nWith multisearch, people can now \nsearch with both images and text  \nat the same time in Google Lens.\n\n6\nWe are also expanding people’s ability to access \ninformation in multiple languages whenever they  \nneed it. Drawing on speech recognition models,  \nwe’ve made video transcriptions available for all \nAndroid and iOS users, and with auto-translated  \nvideo captions in 16 languages on mobile, it’s easier \nfor global audiences to access information. More \npeople are using Google Translate than ever,  \nbut adding languages that are underrepresented \nonline has historically been a challenge. With AI-\npowered machine learning advances, we developed \na monolingual approach where the model learns to \ntranslate a new language without ever seeing a direct \ntranslation of it. As a result, we were able to add  \n24 new languages to Google Translate, including  \nEwe (spoken in West Africa) and Quechua (spoken \nin South America); collectively, those languages are \nspoken by more than 300 million people.\nMaking information accessible and useful also  \nmeans ensuring it helps people during the pandemic. \nWe delivered on our commitment to providing timely, \naccurate information with a number of new features \nacross our products. Searches for “at home COVID \ntests” increased by 170% so we added new features \nto Search to help people quickly find at-home testing \nkits available in stores and nearby testing information \nprovided by local health authorities. In our effort to \namplify trusted information, we pledged an additional \n$150 million in donated Search ads to connect people \nwith authoritative COVID-19 information as they \nsearched, bringing our total in-kind commitment \nto more than $1 billion. In Japan, Brazil, and India \nwe launched new health source information panels \non YouTube to help viewers identify videos from \nauthoritative sources and health content shelves.\nEnglish\nQuechua\nwhat's the weather\nlike today?\n¿lmaynataq kunan\npacha?\nAccess to  \nmore languages\nMachine learning advances enabled us to add 24 new \nlanguages to Google Translate, including languages \nthat are underrepresented online like Quechua.\nAuto-translate\nAuto-translated captions on YouTube \nenable viewers to translate content \ninto 16 different languages.\n\n7\nYear in Review 2022\nIn Maps, it has always been our aim to offer the \nmost intuitive representations of information to help \npeople navigate. With new updates, Maps feels more \nand more like the real world. The AI behind Maps \nkeeps pace with how communities are changing, \nautomatically updating things like business hours and \nspeed limits. With immersive view, you can now see \nphotorealistic multidimensional views of more than \n250 global landmarks like Big Ben or the Acropolis.\nTo help people plan their visit, weather, traffic,  \nand busyness information are layered on top,  \nand predictive modeling anticipates what the next \nday or week might be like.

In \n2022, we shared a new account safety status feature \nacross our apps to flag action that needs to be taken \nto further secure Google Accounts; continued our \nwork toward a passwordless future with passkey,  \na new credential to unlock your account; and made \nupdates to resources like virtual cards and SafeSearch \nto protect payment information and help filter explicit \ncontent for families.\nGoogle has always provided a secure cloud \ninfrastructure, with more than 6 million websites \nprotected from fraud and bots by our cybersecurity \ntechnology. We strengthened our leadership in \nthis area with the acquisition of Mandiant, adding \nindustry-leading threat intelligence and incident \nresponse capabilities. In 2022, Mandiant helped  \nmore than 1,800 customers prepare for or recover \nfrom critical cybersecurity incidents.\nBuilding trust by  \n building a safer \ndigital world\n\n13\nYear in Review 2022\nMy Ad Center\nUsers’ data are theirs to control, and in My Ad Center, \nthey can learn more about the information used to \nserve them ads; with “Customize Ads,” they can \nchoose the topics and brands they want to see more \nor less of.\nProtecting privacy is essential to online safety, \nand we’ve open-sourced privacy-preserving \ntechnologies that we pioneered, including federated \nlearning and differential privacy, to make them \naccessible to developers everywhere. Building upon \nthat work, we introduced Protected Computing, a \ngrowing toolkit of technologies that transform how, \nwhen, and where data are processed to ensure the \nprivacy and safety of your data by minimizing your \ndata footprint, de-identifying data, and restricting \naccess to sensitive data.\nOnline safety also includes having control over \npersonal information. We’ve updated our removal \npolicies and introduced a new tool to make it easier \nto request the removal of Google Search results, \nincluding your contact details such as phone number, \nhome address, and email addresses. We also \nlaunched My Ad Center to give users more control \nover the types of ads they see on YouTube, Search, \nand their Discover feed.\n\n14\n2022 was another year of critical elections happening \nworldwide. Helping voters everywhere find election \ninformation and protecting the accounts of campaigns \nand election officials was paramount. In the U.S., \nwe launched a new feature to help readers discover \nlocal and regional news from different states so they \ncould better understand election coverage of the \nraces they most care about. Through our Campaign \nSecurity Project and partnership with Defending \nDigital Campaigns, we teamed up with organizations \nacross the political spectrum to train more than \n5,500 campaign and election officials in the U.S. on \nsecurity best practices, including products and tools \nthey can use to stay safe online. Globally, we worked \nwith organizations like the International Foundation \nfor Electoral Systems (IFES) to help enhance the \nsecurity of campaigns and affiliated high-risk users. \nWe also made significant investments in enhancing \ntransparency around election advertising, including a \nnew user interface for our Political Ads Transparency \nreport, enabling a more granular breakdown of \nadvertising data.\nElection information  \n in Search\nTo help voters easily access useful, relevant, and \naccurate information in the run-up to elections, \nfeatures in Search shared data from nonpartisan \norganizations and essential information on topics  \nlike voter registration and how to vote.\n\n15\nYear in Review 2022\nSupporting Ukraine\nVice Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykhailo Fedorov \nvisited the Google offices in Washington, D.C.,  \nto discuss the challenges his country is facing  \nand ways to extend Google’s help, including  \nfighting misinformation.\nFighting misinformation is core to our mission, and \nit became especially important among our efforts \nto support Ukraine. People in affected areas turned \nto Search to find the latest news and information \non where to find shelter and aid, so we donated \nSearch advertising for humanitarian relief. To help \nensure reliable access to trustworthy information, \nwe introduced new features, including information \nAnticipating risks\nThe “Hacking Google” series on YouTube provides  \na behind-the-scenes perspective on our hacking \nteams like the Threat Analysis Group, which keeps \nmore people safe online than any other organization \nin the world.\npanels in local languages and transparency labels  \nfor publisher content on YouTube to provide \nadditional context for the information people \nencountered. As disinformation and misinformation \nabout Ukraine spread, we pledged more than  \n$10 million to support partnerships with think  \ntanks and civil society organizations to conduct \nregion-specific research and cash grants for  \nfact-checking networks and nonprofits.\n\n16\nOur growth and success are made possible only when \nwe can help our partners succeed. Between 2019 \nand 2022, we contributed more than $200 billion to \nkey ecosystems, including Google Play developers, \nonline publishers, YouTube creators, artists, and \nmedia organizations. We continued to empower our \ncustomers and partners by delivering the technology \nand support they needed to navigate a rapidly \nchanging landscape with confidence.\nAcross our platforms, people are shopping more than \na billion times a day. Whether they are planning to \nshop online or in store, we’re investing in making the \nexperience as easy, helpful, and engaging as possible. \nShoppers searching for anything from apparel to \nhome goods to electronics will experience a more \nvisual content stream, allowing them to discover, \nbrowse, compare, and research the best product for \nthem. What’s more, if they’re shopping for sneakers, \nbeauty products, or home furnishings, shoppers \ncan now “try before you buy” right in Google Search \nwith AR tools that let you experience products in a \nmore lifelike way. It was also crucial for us to help \nbusinesses reach shoppers at the right moments,  \nand with Performance Max, our AI-powered, goal-\nbased campaign type, Local and Smart Shopping \ncampaigns were optimized to help businesses reach \nnew and existing customers wherever they were in \ntheir journey with relevant, useful content.\nHelping our  \ncustomers and partners \nevolve and grow\nOur AI breakthroughs enabled a number of \nimprovements to make our Ads work harder for \nbusinesses. For instance, with Smart Bidding we  \nuse AI to predict future ad conversions and their  \nvalue, helping businesses anticipate and quickly \nrespond to rapid shifts in demand. Additionally, our \nlarge language models like MUM have enabled us  \nto increase understanding of intent behind language, \nleading to more precise search-query matching with \nadvertiser offers. As a result, when businesses use \nSmart Bidding and upgrade exact match keywords  \nto broad match in campaigns that use a target CPA,  \nthey can see an average of 35% more conversions.\nYouTube Shorts has quickly become a vibrant \nexperience – particularly among Gen Z creators  \nand viewers – reaching 1.5 billion users each month \nand 30 billion daily views in 2022. Ads launched on \nShorts with Video Action, App, and Performance \nMax campaigns available, creating new opportunities \nfor advertisers to reach their audiences. We also \nannounced the extension of the YouTube Partner \nProgram to bring revenue sharing to Shorts, making \nYouTube the only ecosystem where creators can \nmonetize their content across short, long, and live \nformats at scale. Our aim is to provide creators with \nthe best content creation and analytics tools, making \nit easier for them to expand their earning potential.\n\n17\nYear in Review 2022\nGoogle Cloud helps us share our innovations with \ncompanies, governments, and organizations around \nthe world. Through Google Workspace, we delivered \nmore than 300 new capabilities to support hybrid \nand front-line work, including AI-powered features  \nto automate transcriptions and extend the power  \nof smart canvas. We are proud that more than  \n9 million businesses and organizations worldwide  \nrely on Google Workspace for communication  \nand collaboration.\nBeyond Workspace, customers like Ford and Rite \nAid turn to Google Cloud because we offer a single \nplatform that can analyze data across any cloud, and \nour reliable, open infrastructure creates a valuable \npathway to reduce IT costs and accelerate digital \ntransformation. In 2022, we also deepened and \nexpanded relationships with existing customers, like \nKraft Heinz, Deutsche Bank, and Sony’s Crunchyroll, \nhelping bring together the best across Google to build \nsolutions tailored to their industries. For example, \nRenault Group partnered with Google, harnessing \nGoogle Cloud and Android products, to accelerate its \nend-to-end digital transformation, from the design of \nthe car to its production and market launch.\n2022 marked the 10th anniversary of Google Play, \nwhich has grown to be a flourishing app ecosystem \nattracting 2.5 billion people each month, thanks \nto the creativity and partnership from developers. \nTo support developers, we launched several new \nfeatures like custom store listings, a new way to reach \na specific segment of people with messaging relevant \nto them, so they can expand their businesses more \neffectively and efficiently.\nSupporting a sustainable, diverse, and innovative  \nnews ecosystem is critical to our mission. Communities  \naround the world rely on local news to thrive and stay \nconnected. More than 90% of the publications that \nare part of the Google News Showcase, our curated \nonline news experience and licensing program, \nrepresent local, community, and regional news.  \nWe’ve also made improvements to our products to \ngive their content even greater visibility. Now News \nShowcase publishers can pick the most important \nstories from their area for panels that will appear in the  \nlocal section of Google News, immediately connecting \nreaders with the latest news from their community.\nYouTube Shorts\nYouTube Creator Liaison Rene Ritchie shared the news \nthat YouTube Partner Program profit sharing had \ncome to Shorts, giving creators a new revenue stream. \nTry it on with AR\nUsing AR, anyone can now virtually try makeup \nproducts and find their perfect match right from  \nthe Google app.\n\n18\n“The most incredible thing is how \nGoogle Play helped us to spread \nthe game. So many people all over \nthe world now know ÁRIDA, and \nwe are really grateful for that.”\nThrough gaming, Filipe Pereira saw the potential to share Brazil’s heritage \nwith the world. He and his business partner built Aoca Game Lab, which \nlaunched their first title on mobile, ÁRIDA: Backland’s Awakening, a survival \ngame following the adventures of a young girl in the historic town of \nCanudos, Brazil. A recipient of Google Play’s Indie Games Fund, Filipe  \ngot the resources to take the game and his studio to the next level.\n\n19\nYear in Review 2022\nOur commitments\nThrough our products, partnerships, and \ninvestments we aim to bring essential help  \nto people, businesses, and communities.  \nWe acted on that ambition by focusing on \nareas where help is needed most: supporting \neconomic resilience, advancing equity and \ninclusion, and taking on the climate crisis.\n\n20\nEconomic uncertainty in 2022 brought significant tests \nfor job seekers, businesses, and communities, and \nwe sought to provide the support and opportunities \nto clear the path ahead. Small businesses continued \nto be disproportionately impacted by the ongoing \nupheaval, having to adapt to substantial shifts and \nthe new challenges that came with a return to in-\nperson experiences. In the U.K., 60% of small- and \nmedium-sized enterprise (SME) owners believe they \nare operating in a post-pandemic “new normal,” with \ncustomer and employee expectations dramatically \naltered, and 63% say that digital skills and tools are \nnow more important than they were pre-pandemic. \nThrough the Google Digital Garage, those small \nbusinesses can access training in essential online \nskills, and we expanded the program to include \nin-person training on topics like “Digital Marketing \nStrategy” and “Coding” as well as one-to-one \nmentoring with digital experts.\nFor job seekers, finding opportunities often meant \nexpanding their skill set to keep pace with the \ndemands of a shifting job market. In the U.S., nearly \ntwo-thirds of workers do not have a four-year college \ndegree, which means about 70 million Americans \nare locked out of high-growth, high-earning career \npaths1. The Career Certificates program provides \ntraining for careers like data analytics, digital \nmarketing and e-commerce, IT support, project \nSupporting economic \nresilience for people, \ncommunities, and \nbusinesses\n1. “Educational Attainment in the United States: 2021,”  \nCensus Bureau, February 2022.\n\n21\nYear in Review 2022\nExpanding CS education\nAlphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai met with \nIan Bundy-Weiss, an alum of The Hidden Genius \nProject, a nonprofit that provides Black male youth \nwith technology, entrepreneurship, and leadership \ntraining.

In the \nU.S., more than 150,000 people have now completed \nthese certificates, and 75% of them report a positive \ncareer impact within six months, such as a raise \nor new job. But expanding access to the program \nwhere it’s needed most is still an urgent priority. To \nthat end, we announced a $100 million Google Career \nCertificates Fund to support Social Finance, a national \nimpact finance and advisory nonprofit helping more \nthan 20,000 workers in the U.S. take a certificate \nwith wraparound career support – with the potential \nto result in $1 billion in aggregate wage gains. To help \nprepare people for their future careers early on, we \nalso announced a $20 million commitment to expand \ncomputer science education access to more than  \n11 million students across the U.S.\nAs a global company endeavoring to provide access \nto information and technology for each and every \nperson, supporting the digital transformation  \nof developing economies is an essential priority. \nDelivering on our $1 billion investment in Africa’s \ndigital transformation, we helped job seekers and \nentrepreneurs access more opportunity through \nDevelopment Scholarships, Career Certifications,  \nand digital training for small businesses. In Latin \nAmerica, we announced a five-year, $1.2 billion \ncommitment to the region focused on building digital \ninfrastructure, digital skills, entrepreneurship, and \ninclusive, sustainable communities to help accelerate \ntheir digital transformation.\n\n22\n“Last year, I graduated with the \nGoogle IT Support Certificate. \nBefore that, I was self-\nemployed for about 13 years, \nand I’d never really done any \ninterviews. It’s a very anxious \nfeeling ... you’re learning to \nanswer these questions in a \nmuch more professional way. \nBig confidence boost.”\nInterview Warmup is a tool we launched that makes it easier to \npractice for an interview and grow comfortable with the interview \nprocess. Answers to practice questions are transcribed in real  \ntime alongside insights (patterns detected by machine learning)  \nto help job seekers prepare, such as job-related terms they use,  \nthe words they say most often, and the different talking points they \ncover. Interview Warmup helped Le’Mont Calhoun, a Google Career \nCertificates graduate, prepare with confidence and ultimately land  \na new job.\n\n23\nYear in Review 2022\n\n24\nOne of our central tenets is to build belonging for \neveryone at work, in our products, and in society.  \nOur ability to do that starts with building a fair, \ninclusive, and representative workplace. In May, \nwe released updates on our progress in our 2022 \nDiversity Annual Report (DAR), reflecting 2021 gains. \nThe report showed our best hiring year for women \nglobally, as well as our largest gains in representation \nof Black+ and Latinx+ Googlers in the U.S. Still,  \nour work to build a workforce that is a reflection  \nof society’s diversity is far from done.\nAdvancing equity \nand inclusion\nSupporting  \none another\nFei Zou, software engineer, co-leads \nthe Disability Alliance internal resource \ngroup in China. Together, they have \ncreated a space to help address \nchallenges Googlers with disabilities \nface and build allyship.\nWe want to help build an economy that works  \nfor everyone. As a result, we set a 2022 goal to \ngrow our Supplier Diversity impact by spending \n$2.5 billion with diverse suppliers, while expanding \nthe program to include suppliers from historically \nunderrepresented groups around the world;  \nwe exceeded our goal by spending $2.8 billion.  \nWe also deepened our partnerships with nonprofit  \nand community organizations to further expand \naccess to educational and career opportunity, \nincluding a $5 million Google.org grant to Spelman \nCollege’s Center of Excellence for Minority \nWomen in STEM to help build the first database \non the experiences of women from historically \nunderrepresented groups in STEM.\n\n25\nYear in Review 2022\nWe also continued to bring improvements to our \nproducts to help them work better for everyone. \nFor people with disabilities, speech recognition is \nan increasingly important dimension of how people \ninteract with technology, and in 2022, we joined the \nSpeech Accessibility Project, a collaboration between \nresearchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-\nChampaign and five technology companies. The \nuniversity is working with advocacy groups, like Team \nGleason and the Davis Phinney Foundation, to create \ndata sets of impaired speech that can help accelerate \nimprovements to automated speech recognition \n(ASR), a key step toward supporting more than  \n1.5 billion people who are hearing impaired worldwide.\nEach year we seek ways to make sure our products \nrepresent our world. In 2021, we launched Real Tone \nfor Pixel – technology to capture and create more \naccurate images of people of color – and in 2022,  \nwe built on that work by adopting the Monk Skin  \nTone Scale. This tool, created by Harvard professor  \nDr. Ellis Monk, offers a broader spectrum of skin \ntones to inform the technology development process. \nBeyond Pixel, we started using it to achieve more \nequitable representation in Search, Google Photos, \nand more.\nMonk Scale\nThe Monk Skin Tone Scale offers a broader range of \nskin tone shades than is typically used in technology \ndevelopment, helping us build products that better \nreflect the spectrum of skin tones we see in the world.\n\n26\nNBA HBCU  \nFellowship Program\nWith support from Google, the NBA \nFoundation’s NBA HBCU Fellowship Program \nprovides career development opportunities \nin basketball for students at Historically Black \nColleges and Universities like Aniya Mahaffey,  \na student at North Carolina Central University.\nMedicare/Medicaid \nSearch filters\nTo help Medicare and Medicaid participants easily \naccess information most relevant to them, Search \nfilters can show them nearby health care providers \nthat accept Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n27\nYear in Review 2022\n“Every voice we add enriches it.  \nAnd every voice we lose diminishes it.”\nLaurence Moroney is a developer advocate at Google focusing on artificial \nintelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). He focuses on inviting and introducing \nmore people to roles in the AI and ML fields through coursework, workshops, and \nboot camps that help developers gain job skills. He says, “A cynical person might \nsay businesses just want to check off diversity boxes, but for us, it’s not a box  \nto check. It’s a huge opportunity for what we’re creating to be so much better.”\n\n28\nThe climate crisis remains humanity’s greatest \ncollective challenge, and we build sustainability  \ninto our operations, products, partnerships,  \nand investments. Our goal to operate our data  \ncenter and office campuses on 24/7 carbon-\nfree energy by 2030 remains one of our greatest \nambitions, and we have made significant progress –  \nthis is part of our broader goal to achieve net zero \nemissions across our operations and value chain, \nincluding consumer hardware products, by 2030.\nTo expand access to clean energy, we supported \nclean energy projects, including new solar and wind \nprojects in the U.S., U.K., Denmark, Spain, Finland, \nand Chile. To ensure we’re optimizing our operations, \nwe use AI technology to shift flexible compute tasks \nat our data centers across time and space to better \nalign with lower-carbon hours on the grid, using our \ncarbon-intelligent computing platform. We advanced \nthe development of time-based energy attribute \ncertificates (T-EACs), a tool to enable clean energy \nproduction, consumption, and trading to be tracked \non an hourly basis.\nWe also unveiled a number of new features across \nour products to help people make environmentally \nconscious choices each day. For enterprise customers, \nGoogle Cloud launched a pilot program to help \ncustomers transition to clean energy by building  \na clear picture of their electricity emissions profile \nusing AI-generated historical and real-time insights. \nIn Maps, we expanded cycling navigation guidance \nwith new information to easily compare bike routes \nand get granular details about the route (where data \nare available) to prepare for the ride ahead. People \ncan now also find sustainable hotel options with the \n“eco-certified” filter, with each hotel offering details \non their practices like waste reduction or sustainable \nsourcing, and they can compare flight emissions \nfor similar trips in Google Flights. Anticipating \nenvironmental risks is a critical challenge; we globally \nlaunched FloodHub, an AI-powered platform that \ndisplays flood forecasts and shows when and where \nfloods may occur to help organizations prepare.\nTo help maximize the life of our hardware and reduce \ne-waste, we made it simpler for anyone to repair, \nreturn, or recycle their Pixel phone. People in the U.S., \nU.K., Canada, Australia, and EU countries where Pixel \nis available can now find spare parts for many of our \nolder Pixel models through Pixel 7 Pro and future Pixel \nmodels on ifixit.com.

We do not intend \nto become one.” That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring us to tackle big problems and \ninvest in moonshots, such as our long-term opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). We continue this work under the leadership of \nAlphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and \nGoogle Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Alphabet’s structure is about helping each of our \nbusinesses prosper through strong leaders and independence.\nAccess and technology for everyone\nThe Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people and businesses large and small. Our mission to \norganize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was when we were founded \nin 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that also helps people get things \ndone. \nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools they need to increase \ntheir knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information and make sense of the world in more \nnatural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year. YouTube provides people with entertainment, information, \nand opportunities to learn something new. Google Assistant offers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different \ndevices, providing intelligent help throughout a person’s day, no matter where they are. Google Cloud helps customers solve today’s \nbusiness challenges, improve productivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and building \nnew products and features that will help our users, partners, customers, and communities and have invested more than $100 billion \nin research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.\nMoonshots\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads \nto irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were \ncrazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, but those efforts have matured into major platforms \nfor digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term \nwithin each of our segments. As we said in the original founders’ letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that \nwe believe in, as they are the key to our long-term success.\nThe power of AI\nWe believe that AI is a foundational and transformational technology that will provide compelling and helpful benefits to people \nand society through its capacity to assist, complement, empower, and inspire people in almost every field of human endeavor. As \nan information and computer science company, we will continue to be at the forefront of advancing the frontier of AI. Through our \npath-breaking and field-defining research and development, we responsibly and boldly develop more capable and useful AI every day. \nAI already powers Google’s core products that help billions of people every day and has been at the foundation of our core ads quality \nsystems for years, helping large and small businesses all over the world to produce and run effective and efficient ad campaigns \nthat help grow their businesses. AI makes it possible to search in new languages, with multiple inputs, such as using images and \ntext at the same time with the Google App. Some of our most popular products at Google — including Lens and Translate — were \nbuilt entirely using artificial intelligence technologies such as optical character recognition and machine learning. Google Cloud \ncontinues to build AI into numerous solutions that our customers can use to develop AI-powered applications — including processing \ndocuments, images, and translation — to understand and analyze data more efficiently, and to use packaged solutions for a variety \nof industries. In all these examples, AI significantly enhances the usefulness and multiplies the value of these products and services to \npeople and organizations.\n\n2\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1  BUSINESS\nOur view is that AI is now, and more than ever, critical to delivering on our mission. As we bring our breakthrough AI innovations into \nthe real world to assist people and benefit society everywhere, we are also pursuing further advancements that will help to unlock \nscientific discoveries and to tackle humanity’s greatest challenges and opportunities.\nPrivacy and security\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are near-term financial \nconsequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default; strictly upholding responsible \ndata practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that put people in control. We are continually \nenhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete their data, giving them new tools, such as My Ad Center, \nto control their ad experience, or advancing anti-malware, anti-phishing, and password security features.\nGoogle\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\nGoogle Services\nSERVING OUR USERS\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people worldwide. Our product \ninnovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Google Services’ core \nproducts and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, \nSearch, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by users around the world.\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than two decades ago. Rather than the \nten blue links in our early search results, users can now get direct answers to their questions using their computer or mobile device, \ntheir own voice, a photo, or an image, making it quicker, easier, and more natural to find what they are looking for. Of the searches \nwe see every day, 15% are new.\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and creation of digital \ncontent both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are consuming many forms of digital content, \nincluding watching videos, playing games, listening to music, reading books, and using apps. Working with content creators and \npartners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to find great digital content.\nFueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and hardware. That is why we continue to invest in platforms \nlike our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as well as growing our family of hardware \ndevices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people’s lives easier by combining the best of our AI, software, \nand hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of hardware products such as the new Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, and \nthe very first Pixel Watch. Creating products that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long-term.\nHOW WE MAKE MONEY\nWe have built world-class advertising technologies for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital marketing businesses. \nOur advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across devices and \nformats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships \nwith brands and agencies. \nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on Google Search & \nother properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners’ properties (“Google Network properties”). We continue to invest in both \nperformance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of advertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness \nof their campaigns.\n \nz Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct engagement with advertisers. \nPerformance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results. Our ads tools allow performance \nadvertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n \nz Brand advertising helps enhance users’ awareness of and affinity for advertisers’ products and services, through videos, text, \nimages, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types \nof ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns. \nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating \nthe best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering out invalid traffic, removing billions \nof bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them \nwhen necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\n\n3\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1  BUSINESS\nWe continue to focus on growing revenues beyond advertising, from Google Play, hardware, and YouTube subscriptions, such as: \n \nz Google Play generates revenues from sales of apps and in-app purchases.\n \nz Hardware generates revenues from sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices.\n \nz YouTube non-advertising generates subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle was a company built in the cloud, and we continue to invest in our Google Cloud offerings, including Google Cloud Platform \nand Google Workspace. Google Cloud Platform provides leading technology in cybersecurity; data, analytics, AI, and machine learning; \nand infrastructure. Our cybersecurity products help customers detect, protect, and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats. \nOur data cloud unifies data lakes, data warehouses, data governance, and advanced machine learning into a single platform that \ncan analyze data across any cloud. We provide customers an open, reliable, and scalable infrastructure that enables them to run \nworkloads anywhere — on our Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. Additionally, Google Workspace’s easy-to-use and secure \ncommunication and collaboration tools, which include apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet, and more, enable secure hybrid \nwork, boosting productivity and collaboration. \nOther Bets\nAcross Alphabet we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries from improving \ntransportation and health technology to exploring solutions to address climate change. Alphabet’s investment in the portfolio of \nOther Bets includes businesses that are at various stages of development, ranging from those in the R&D phase to those that are in \nthe beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as \nindependent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. While these \nearly-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making \nimportant strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and \ninternet services.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable competition in every \naspect of our business, including, among others, from:\n \nz general purpose search engines and information services;\n \nz vertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries related to travel, jobs, and health, which users may navigate directly \nto rather than go through Google;\n \nz online advertising platforms and networks;\n \nz other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers typically advertise \nin multiple media, both online and offline;\n \nz digital content and application platform providers;\n \nz providers of enterprise cloud services;\n \nz companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed \nproprietary platforms;\n \nz providers of digital video services; \n \nz social networks, which users may rely on for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search \nengines;\n \nz providers of workspace communication and connectivity products; and \n \nz digital assistant providers.\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the \nmarketplace across our businesses. For example, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n \nz users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, \nas well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n \nz advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements \nin an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n\n4\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1  BUSINESS\n \nz content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from \nadvertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nOngoing Commitment to Sustainability\nWe believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect our planet. Sustainability is one of our core values at \nGoogle, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. We have been a leader on sustainability and climate change since \nGoogle’s founding more than 20 years ago. These are some of our key achievements over the past two decades:\n \nz In 2007, we became the first major company to be carbon neutral for our operations.\n \nz In 2017, we became the first major company to match 100% of our annual electricity use with renewable energy, which we have \nachieved for five consecutive years.\n \nz In 2020, we issued $5.75 billion in sustainability bonds—the largest sustainability or green bond issuance by any company in \nhistory at the time. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to fund environmentally and socially responsible projects in the \nfollowing eight areas: energy efficiency, clean energy, green buildings, clean transportation, circular economy and design, affordable \nhousing, commitment to racial equity, and support for small businesses and COVID-19 crisis response. As of 2022, we had fully \nallocated the net proceeds from our sustainability bonds as outlined in our Sustainability Bond Impact Report published in 2022.\nOur sustainability strategy is focused on three key pillars: accelerating the transition to carbon-free energy and a circular economy, \nempowering everyone with technology, and benefiting the people and places where we operate.\nTo accelerate the transition to a carbon-free and circular economy, in 2020, we launched our third decade of climate action, and we \nare now working toward a new set of ambitious goals. By 2030, we aim to:\n \nz achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, including our consumer hardware products;\n \nz become the first major company to run on carbon-free energy 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year;\n \nz enable 5 gigawatts of new carbon-free energy through investments in our key manufacturing regions; and\n \nz help more than 500 cities and local governments reduce an aggregate of 1 gigaton (one billion tons) of carbon emissions annually.\nWe also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains and to enable others to \ndo the same.\nWe are committed to helping people make more sustainable choices by empowering them with technology. We introduced eco-friendly \nrouting in Google Maps; new features to book flights or purchase appliances that have lower carbon footprints; and when people \ncome to Google Search with questions about climate change, we show information from authoritative sources like the United Nations.\nTo benefit the people and places where we operate, we have set goals to replenish more water than we consume by 2030 and to \nsupport water security in communities where we operate. We are focused on three areas: enhancing our stewardship of water \nresources across Google offices and data centers; replenishing our water use and improving watershed health and ecosystems in \nwater-stressed communities; and sharing technology and tools that help everyone predict, prevent, and recover from water stress. \nAt Google we remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainability, and we will continue to lead and encourage others to join us \nin improving the health of our planet. We are proud of what we have achieved so far, and we are energized to help move the world \ncloser to a more sustainable and carbon-free future for all.\nMore information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports, including Google’s Environmental \nReport. The contents of our sustainability reports are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any \nother report or document we file with the SEC. For additional information about risks and uncertainties applicable to our commitments \nto attain certain sustainability goals, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCulture and Workforce\nWe are a company of curious, talented, and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and encourage the iteration \nof ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society.\nOur people are critical for our continued success, so we work hard to create an environment where employees can have fulfilling \ncareers, and be happy, healthy, and productive. We offer industry-leading benefits and programs to take care of the diverse needs of our \nemployees and their families, including opportunities for career growth and development, resources to support their financial health, \nand access to excellent healthcare choices. Our competitive compensation programs help us to attract and retain top candidates, \nand we will continue to invest in recruiting talented people to technical and non-technical roles, and rewarding them well. We provide \na variety of high quality training and support to managers to build and strengthen their capabilities—ranging from courses for new \nmanagers, to learning resources that help them provide feedback and manage performance, to coaching and individual support.\n\n5\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1  BUSINESS\nAt Alphabet we are committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is \nrepresentative of the users we serve. More information on Google’s approach to diversity can be found in our annual diversity reports, \navailable publicly at diversity.google. The contents of our diversity reports are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report \non Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.\n As of December 31, 2022, Alphabet had 190,234 employees. We have work councils and statutory employee representation obligations \nin certain countries, and we are committed to supporting protected labor rights, maintaining an open culture, and listening to all \nemployees. Supporting healthy and open dialogue is central to how we work, and we communicate information about the company \nthrough multiple internal channels to our employees.\nWhen necessary we contract with businesses around the world to provide specialized services where we do not have appropriate \nin-house expertise or resources, often in fields that require specialized training like cafe operations, content moderation, customer \nsupport, and physical security. We also contract with temporary staffing agencies when we need to cover short-term leaves, when we \nhave spikes in business needs, or when we need to quickly incubate special projects. We choose our partners and staffing agencies \ncarefully, and review their compliance with Google’s Supplier Code of Conduct. We continually make improvements to promote a \nrespectful and positive working environment for everyone — employees, vendors, and temporary staff alike.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to numerous United States (U.S.) federal, state, and local, as well as foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety \nof subjects. Like other companies in the technology industry, we face heightened scrutiny from both U.S. and foreign governments \nwith respect to our compliance with laws and regulations. Many of these laws and regulations are evolving and their applicability \nand scope, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain. Particularly with regard to data privacy and security; content moderation; \ncompetition; consumer protection; climate change and sustainability; and reporting on human capital and diversity, we have seen \nan increase in new and evolving laws and regulations, as well as related enforcement actions, being proposed and implemented in \nrecent years by legislative bodies around the world.\nOur compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could, individually or in the aggregate, increase our cost of \ndoing business, make our products and services less useful, limit our ability to pursue certain business models, cause us to change \nour business practices, affect our competitive position relative to our peers, and/or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, \nreputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Risk Factors in Item 1A; Trends in Our Business \nand Financial Effect in Part II, Item 7; and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \nPart II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology \nand our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain \nnames, and copyrights. We have also filed patent applications in the U.S. and foreign countries covering certain of our technology, \nand acquired patent assets to supplement our portfolio. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, \ncertain of our rights to other parties.

Reduced spending by advertisers, a loss of partners, or new \nand existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize ads could harm our business. \nWe generated more than 80% of total revenues from online advertising in 2022. Many of our advertisers, companies that distribute \nour products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at any time. These partners \nmay not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new \nsales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising \npolicies and data privacy practices, as well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the \npast, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that \nmake customized ads more difficult or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services have integrated \nthese technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide \nsuperior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and \noperating results. \nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions have \naffected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on \nadvertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. \nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, \ncustomers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our business, financial condition, and \noperating results. \nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing technologies, shifting user \nneeds, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately anticipate technology \ndevelopments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses \nevolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant \nresources in R&D, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services. \nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from \nlarge and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer operating histories and well established \nrelationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position, \nincluding by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in R&D and in talent, initiating intellectual property and competition \nclaims (whether or not meritorious), and continuing to compete for users, advertisers, customers, and content providers. Further, \ndiscrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those laws without \ncommensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide \nproducts and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before us. \nOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the evolving needs \nand desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. As new and existing technologies continue to \ndevelop, competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or \nbetter than ours. These technologies could reduce usage of our products and services, and force us to compete in different ways \nand expend significant resources to develop and operate equal or better products and services. Competitors’ success in providing \ncompelling products and services or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers could \nharm our financial condition and operating results. \nOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could divert \nmanagement attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The investments that we \nare making across our businesses, such as in AI, reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services that are \nuseful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our investments span a wide range of industries beyond \n\n7\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nonline advertising. Such investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, \nin pursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities. These endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, \nincluding diversion of resources and management attention from current operations and the use of alternative investment, governance, \nor compensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives. \nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones, home devices, and wearables, which is \na highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption of technological advancements \nby competitors, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in performance characteristics, and \nprice and feature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware \nthat competes effectively. \nWithin Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, including Google \nCloud Platform and Google Workspace. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing \nservices, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales force. At the same time, our competitors \nare rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models are competitive and constantly evolving, \nand we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives. Further, our business with public sector \ncustomers may present additional risks, including regulatory compliance risks. For instance, we may be subject to government audits \nand cost reviews, and any failure to comply or any deficiencies found may expose us to legal, financial, and/or reputational risks. \nEvolving laws and regulations may require us to make new capital investments, build new products, and seek partners to deliver \nlocalized services in other countries, and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements. \nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among others. These \ninvestment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and our offerings, many of which \ninvolve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be able to compete effectively or operate at \nsufficient levels of profitability. \nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, require significant investment and raise ethical, \ntechnological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and \nservices. Because all of these investment areas are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings \nwill be successful or will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future. \nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the devices and modalities \nused to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines in advertiser spending; competition; \ncustomer usage and demand for our products; decreases in our pricing of our products and services; ongoing product and policy \nchanges; and shifts to lower priced products and services. \nIn addition, we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors, such as the \ncontinued expansion of our business into new fields, including products and services such as hardware, Google Cloud, and subscription \nproducts, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those we generate from \nadvertising. In particular, margins on our hardware products have had, and may continue to have, an adverse affect on our consolidated \nmargins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins \nfrom increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increasing costs for many aspects of our business. Further, certain of our \ncosts and expenses are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, in conjunction \nwith our efforts to re-engineer costs, we may not be able to execute these efforts in a timely manner or these efforts may not be \nsuccessful. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating \nmargin may not be indicative of our future performance. For additional information, see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect \nand Revenues and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, \nand brands as well as affect our ability to compete. \nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events \noutside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services, and technologies. For \nexample, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are \ndistributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be \nsufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect \nsome of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later \nturn out to be important. There is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued \npatent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable. \n\n8\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitive \ninformation could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets. \nWe also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word “Google” could become so commonly \nused that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” Some courts have ruled that “Google” is a protectable trademark, but it \nis possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S., may reach a different determination. If this happens, we could \nlose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus \ndiminishing our brand. \nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting \nour intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could \nmake it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating results. \nOur business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our \nbase of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. \nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google \nServices, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products and \nservices that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. Our brands have \nbeen, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party \ncontent shared on our platforms, data privacy and security issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. \nFor example, if we fail to respond appropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or \nproducts or objectionable practices by advertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence \nin our brands. \nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating \nresults. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality, trustworthy, \ninnovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of settings. \nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability to supply both \nour products and our services. \nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our hardware products and servers and networking equipment used \nin our technical infrastructure, and we may supply the contract manufacturers with components to assemble the hardware products \nand equipment. We also rely on other companies to participate in the distribution of our products and services. Our business could \nbe negatively affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, \nor if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes \nin the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them. \nWe have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages, price increases, and/or longer lead times that could \nnegatively affect our operations, driven by raw material, component availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry \nallocations, logistics capacity, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs, sanctions and export controls, trade disputes and \nbarriers, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters or pandemics, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, \ndrought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and \nincreased storm severity), power loss, and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers. In addition, \nsome of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and our hardware products are available from only one or limited \nsources, and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. \nA significant supply interruption that affects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay \nconsumer product availability. \nWe may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and conditions. We may \nface costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological change, changed consumer \npreferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of our hardware supply contracts have \nvolume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected \ntargets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our products more \ncostly per unit to manufacture and harm our financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may \nnegotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive \nadvantages and may affect our supply. \n\n9\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nOur products and services have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, or operations. \nSometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our \nproducts and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are defective, it could harm our reputation, financial \ncondition, and operating results. \nWe require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies and practices, such \nas the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance, \nand intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. Violations of law or unethical business practices \ncould result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. Their failure to \nprocure necessary license rights to intellectual property could affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to \nlitigation or financial claims. \nInterruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications systems could hurt our \nability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nThe availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation of our \ninformation technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage, interference, or interruption from \nmodifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters or pandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed \nconflicts, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects \nand power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, telecommunications failures, \ncomputer viruses, software bugs, ransomware attacks, computer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to \nharm or access our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural \ndisasters. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential \ndisruptions resulting from problems experienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts \nhappening in the area. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. \nThe occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic, closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems affecting our data centers \ncould result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and have \ncontained in the past, and may contain in the future, errors or vulnerabilities, which could result in interruptions in or failure of our \nservices or systems. Any of these incidents could impede or prevent us from effectively offering products and providing services, \nwhich could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow internationally. International \nrevenues accounted for approximately 51% of our consolidated revenues in 2022. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this \nsection, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following:\n \nz restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating \ncash earned in countries outside the U.S.;\n \nz import and export requirements, tariffs, and other market access barriers that may prevent or impede us from offering products or \nproviding services to a particular market, or that could limit our ability to source assemblies and finished products from a particular \nmarket, and may increase our operating costs;\n \nz longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;\n \nz an evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to new regulatory costs and \nchallenges (including new customer requirements), in addition to other adverse effects that we are unable to effectively anticipate;\n \nz sanctions, export controls, and trade restrictions that limit our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to comply with local laws, \nincluding as a result of geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine;\n \nz political unrest, conflict, and changes in governmental regimes that may adversely affect demand and usage of our products and \nservices, may limit the ability for people in certain areas to access and use our products and services, or may impede us from \noffering products or providing services to a particular market; \n \nz anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain payments to government \nofficials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties;\n \nz uncertainty regarding regulatory outcomes and other liabilities, including uncertainty as a result of local laws, insufficient due \nprocess, and lack of legal precedent; and\n \nz different employee/employer relationships, existence of works councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, \nlanguage, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions.\n\n10\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nBecause we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we have faced, and \nwill continue to face, exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a portion of our international \ncurrency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect \nour revenues and earnings. Hedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our \nfinancial condition and operating results. \nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial statements incorporate \nvaluation methodologies that are subjective in nature resulting in fluctuations over time. \nThe fair value of our investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the past, negatively affected by liquidity, \ncredit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying entities, foreign exchange rates, changes in interest \nrates, including changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, \nthe stock market in general, or other factors. \nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-based compensation \nawards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, at fair value on \na nonrecurring basis. The determination of fair value involves use of appropriate valuation methods and certain unobservable inputs, \nrequires management judgment and estimation, and may change over time. We adjust the carrying value of our non-marketable \nequity securities to fair value for observable transactions of identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairments. \nAll gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, are recognized in other income (expense), which increases the volatility \nof our other income (expense). The unrealized gains and losses we record from fair value remeasurements of our non-marketable \nequity securities in any particular period may differ significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately realize on such investments. \nAs a result of these factors, the value of our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. \nRisks Related to our Industry \nPeople access the Internet through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the advancement of \ntechnology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our products and services \ndeveloped for these interfaces, our business could be harmed. \nPeople access the Internet through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, mobile phones, smartphones, laptops \nand tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables, automobiles, and television-streaming devices. Our products \nand services may be less popular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards \nfor its devices, and our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited functionality for our users \nor our advertisers on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices. In \naddition, search queries may be undertaken via voice-activated search, apps, social media or other platforms, which could harm our \nbusiness. It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive \nnew products and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services \nacross multiple platforms and devices. Failing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers, suppliers, \ndistributors, developers, and users, or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and platforms, \ncould harm our business, financial condition, and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities. \nData privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our reputation, cause us to incur \nsignificant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. Computer viruses, \nsoftware bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks on our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data \nand interference with our users’ and customers’ ability to use our products and services, harming our business and reputation. \nConcerns about, including the adequacy of, our practices with regard to the collection, use, governance, disclosure, or security of \npersonal data or other data-privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and \noperating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as expectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change. \nOur products and services involve the storage, handling, and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive information. Software \nbugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss or improper \nuse and disclosure of such information, which could result in litigation and other potential liabilities, including regulatory fines and \npenalties, as well as reputational harm. Additionally, our products incorporate highly technical and complex technologies, and thus \nour technologies and software have contained, and are likely in the future to contain, undetected errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities. \nWe have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, some errors in our software code only after we have released the \ncode. Systems and control failures, security breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent disclosure of \n\n11\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nuser data could result in government and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation, brand, and business, and impair our ability \nto attract and retain users or customers. Such incidents have occurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and \nnature of our products and services. While there is no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage, we expect \nto continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs, theft, misuse, and security \nvulnerabilities or breaches. \nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. Cyber attacks \ncontinue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. We have seen, and \nwill continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, such as the Log4j vulnerability reported in December 2021, \nwhich could affect our or other parties’ systems. We expect to continue to experience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. \nOur efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform may also increase the risk of retaliatory attack. In addition, we face the risk \nof cyber attacks by nation-states and state-sponsored actors. These attacks may target us or our customers, particularly our public \nsector customers (including federal, state, and local governments). Geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing \nconflict in Ukraine, may increase these risks. \nWe may experience security issues, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, system errors, or vulnerabilities in our \nor other parties’ systems. While we may not determine some of these issues to be material at the time they occur and may remedy \nthem quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal, financial, and reputational harm, \nincluding government inquiries, enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. There is also no guarantee that a series of \nissues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the aggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the \ntime of their occurrence. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, disable or degrade service provided by or \notherwise sabotage systems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a target, even taking all \nreasonable precautions, including those required by law, we have been unable in the past and may continue to be unable to anticipate \nor detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures. \nFurther, if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data-security practices, \nfail to comply with our terms and policies, or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach, our users’ data may be improperly \naccessed, used, or disclosed. If an actual or perceived breach of our or our business partners’ or service providers’ security occurs, \nthe market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures would be harmed, we could lose users and customers, our trade \nsecrets or those of our business partners may be compromised, and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, \nincluding legal claims (which may include class-action litigation) and regulatory actions, fines, and penalties. Any of the foregoing \nconsequences could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nWhile we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including dedicated worldwide \nincident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, may not be adequate, \nmay fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to prevent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently \nremediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal, reputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, \nfinancial condition, and operating results. \nFor additional information, see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under ‘Risks Related to Laws, Regulations, \nand Policies’ below.\nOur ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of our platforms and misuse \nof user data. \nIn addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety, security, and review \nefforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties, including investigation and review \nof platform applications that could access the information of users of our services. As a result of these efforts, we have in the past \ndiscovered, and may in the future discover, incidents of unnecessary access to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity \nby third parties. However, we may not have discovered, and may in the future not discover, all such incidents or activity, whether as \na result of our data limitations, including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, or \nother factors, including factors outside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic, and we may learn of such incidents or \nactivity via third parties. Such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with \nour terms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper ad purchases, \nactivities that threaten people’s safety on- or off-line, or instances of spamming, scraping, or spreading disinformation. While we \nmay not determine some of these incidents to be material at the time they occurred and we may remedy them quickly, there is no \nguarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including government \ninquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. There is also no guarantee that a series of issues may not be \ndetermined to be material at a later date in the aggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. \n\n12\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nWe may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such incidents. Any of the \nforegoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and brands, require us to change \nour business practices in ways that harm our business operations, and adversely affect our business and financial results. Any such \ndevelopments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and \ndamages, divert management’s time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight. \nProblematic content on our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content farms, and other \nviolations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could harm our reputation and deter our current and \npotential users from using our products and services. \nWe, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms, including sophisticated attempts by \nbad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate revenues, or to otherwise generate traffic that \ndoes not represent genuine user interest or intent. While we invest significantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant results \nand to detect and prevent low-quality content and invalid traffic, we have been unable and may continue to be unable to detect and \nprevent all such abuses or promote uniformly high-quality content. \nMany websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than \nour search engine’s assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have affected, and may continue to affect, \nthe quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading, or undesirable content. Although English-language \nweb spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will \ncontinue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their rankings. We continuously combat web spam in our search results, including \nthrough indexing technology that makes it harder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. We also continue to invest in \nand deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our platforms. We also face other challenges from low-quality \nand irrelevant content websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to \nhelp them improve their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent abuse \nfrom low-quality websites. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including violations of our content guidelines involving \nincidents such as attempted election interference, activities that threaten the safety and/or well-being of our users on- or off-line, \nand the spreading of misinformation or disinformation. \nIf we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality content, it could hurt \nour reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our financial condition and operating \nresults. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in monetary penalties and damages and divert \nmanagement’s time and attention. \nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may \nbe able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional \nexpenses and the loss of users and advertisers. \nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant \nbandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband \nand internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, \nand government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that \ncould degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their \ninfrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing \nour competitors preferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet \naccess providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. For example, in 2018 \nthe U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could permit internet access providers to restrict, \nblock, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services. In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and \nservices have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or blockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including \nwith our users, customers, advertisers, and/or content providers, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and \nincrease costs, thereby negatively affecting our business. \n\n13\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies \nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm our business, and will \nlikely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue to expand our business. \nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects, and our introduction of new \nbusinesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws and regulations. In recent years, \ngovernments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new laws and regulations relevant to the digital \neconomy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and security, competition, and online content. The costs of compliance with these \nmeasures are high and are likely to increase in the future. \nNew or changing laws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner inconsistent \nwith our practices, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, less useful products and services, altered business practices, \nlimited ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and services, substantial costs, and civil or criminal liability. \nExamples include laws and regulations regarding: \n \nz Competition and technology platforms’ business practices: Laws and regulations focused on large technology platforms, including \nthe Digital Markets Act in the European Union (EU); regulations in South Korea and elsewhere that affect Google Play’s billing \npolicies, fees, and business model; as well as regulations under consideration in a range of jurisdictions.\n \nz Data privacy, collection, and processing: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, processing, and/or sharing of user \nor advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws, laws affecting the processing of children’s data (as discussed \nfurther below), data breach notification laws, and laws limiting data transfers (including data localization laws). \n \nz Copyright and other intellectual property: Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single \nMarket and European Economic Area transpositions, which may introduce new licensing regimes, increase liability with respect \nto content uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms, or create property rights in news publications that could require \npayments to news agencies and publishers. \n \nz Content moderation: Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure obligations, such as the EU’s \nDigital Services Act, Florida’s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas’ House Bill 20, and laws and proposed legislation in Singapore, Australia, \nand the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure to remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information \nabout the operation of our services and algorithms, which may make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to \ndetect and deal with low-quality, deceptive, or harmful content.\n \nz Consumer protection: Consumer protection laws, including the EU’s New Deal for Consumers, which could result in monetary \npenalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain and \ncould be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For example, we rely on statutory safe harbors, like those set forth in the \nDigital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive in \nEurope, to protect against liability for various linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and hosting activities. Legislation or court \nrulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us and may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative \nproposals and pending litigation in the U.S. (such as Gonzalez v. Google), EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate \nsafe harbor protection for websites and online platforms. \nWe are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, enforcement actions, \nconsent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability that could harm our business, reputation, financial \ncondition, and operating results.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving \ncompetition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, \ncontent generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other \nmatters. We also are subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related \nto product defects, among other litigation, and we may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials \nusage, other environmental effects, or service disruptions or failures. Claims have been brought, and we expect will continue to be \nbrought, against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright and trademark infringement, unfair competition, \nunlawful activity, torts, privacy rights violations, fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature and content of information available \non or via our services or due to our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to content created \nby third parties. \n\n14\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nFor example, the U.S. Department of Justice, various U.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed several antitrust lawsuits about various \naspects of our business, including our advertising technologies and practices, the operation and distribution of Google Search, and \nthe operation and distribution of the Android operating system and Play Store. Other regulatory agencies in the U.S. and around the \nworld, including competition enforcers, consumer protection agencies, and data protection authorities, have challenged and may \ncontinue to challenge our business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. We are cooperating with these investigations \nand defending litigation where appropriate. Various laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions \nhave in the past, and may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing \nobligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil \nlitigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nAny of these legal proceedings could result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and other harms to \nour business. Estimating liabilities for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment, and \nthe amounts we are ultimately liable for may exceed our estimates. The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, \nand may in the future result in, additional substantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, \nreputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nPrivacy, data protection, and data usage regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Any failure or alleged failure to \ncomply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nAuthorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data \nprotection, data usage, and encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation have resulted in, and may continue \nto result in, fines and orders requiring that we change our practices, which have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on \nhow we provide services, harming our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. These laws and regulations \nare evolving and subject to interpretation, and compliance obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs or harm the quality \nand operations of our products and services in ways that harm our business. Examples of these laws include: \n \nz The General Data Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulations, which apply to all of our \nactivities conducted from an establishment in the EU or the United Kingdom, respectively, or related to products and services \nthat we offer to EU or the United Kingdom users or customers, respectively, or the monitoring of their behavior in the EU or \nthe UK, respectively.\n \nz Various state and foreign privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, the California \nPrivacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, and the \nUtah Consumer Privacy Act, all of which give new data privacy rights to their respective residents (including, in California, a private \nright of action in the event of a data breach resulting from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures \nand practices) and impose significant obligations on controllers and processors of consumer data.\n \nz State laws governing the processing of biometric information, such as the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act and the Texas \nCapture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act, which impose obligations on businesses that collect or disclose consumer biometric \ninformation. \n \nz Various federal, state, and foreign laws governing how companies provide age appropriate experiences to children and minors, \nincluding the collection and processing of children and minor’s data. These include the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act \nof 1998, the United Kingdom Age-Appropriate Design Code, and the California Age Appropriate Design Code, all of which address \nthe use and disclosure of the personal data of children and minors and impose obligations on online services or products directed \nto or likely to be accessed by children. \n \nz The California Internet of Things Security Law, which regulates the security of data used in connection with internet-connected \ndevices.\n \nz The EU’s Digital Markets Act, which will require in-scope companies to obtain user consent for combining data across certain \nproducts and require search engines to share anonymized data with rival companies, among other changes. \nFurther, we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, \nprocess and/or receive personal data. Previously available transfer mechanisms, such as the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy \nShield frameworks, were invalidated in 2020, and other bases for data transfer and storage, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, \nremain subject to ongoing review in ways that may require us to adapt our existing contractual arrangements. The validity of various \ndata transfer mechanisms remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments in both Europe and the U.S., including the \npotential adoption of the U.S.-EU Data Privacy Framework. Until the U.S.-EU Data Privacy Framework is adopted by the EU, the legal \nuncertainty and ongoing enforcement action from supervisory authorities related to cross-border transfers of personal data, could \nharm our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area and could in turn harm our ability to \nprovide, and our customers’ ability to use, some of our products and services. \n\n15\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend, result in significant \ndamage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to use certain technologies. \nWe, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or \nother violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and trademarks. Parties have also sought \nbroad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) \nfor exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-holding companies may frequently seek to generate income from \npatents they have obtained by bringing claims against us. As we continue to expand our business, the number of intellectual property \nclaims against us has increased and may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies. \nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses \nare available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or elsewhere, including by preventing us \nfrom offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain jurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our \nbusiness practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. \nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend against certain intellectual \nproperty infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, \nwhich could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such \nclaims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of \ninjunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and harm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities \nprovided to us by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising \nfrom intellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future \nagree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual property claims. Regardless \nof their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. To the extent such claims \nare successful, they could harm our business, including our product and service offerings, financial condition, and operating results. \nExpectations relating to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations could expose us to potential liabilities, \nincreased costs, and reputational harm. \nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and other measures that govern a wide range of topics, including those related to matters beyond \nour core products and services. For instance, new laws, regulations, policies, and international accords relating to ESG matters, \nincluding sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are being developed and formalized in Europe, the U.S., and \nelsewhere, which may entail specific, target-driven frameworks and/or disclosure requirements. We have implemented robust ESG \nprograms, adopted reporting frameworks and principles, and announced a number of goals and initiatives. The implementation of \nthese goals and initiatives may require considerable investments, and our goals, with all of their contingencies, dependencies, and \nin certain cases, reliance on third-party verification and/or performance, are complex and ambitious, may change, and we cannot \nguarantee that we will achieve them. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to adhere to our public statements, comply fully with \ndeveloping interpretations of ESG laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could \nharm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional \ntax liabilities. \nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax \nrates are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, \nnet gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, decreases in our \nstock price for shares issued as employee compensation, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the \napplication of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the \ninterpretation of existing laws). Further, if we are unable or fail to collect taxes on behalf of customers, employees and partners as \nthe withholding agent, we could become liable for taxes that are levied against third parties. \nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have received, and may in \nthe future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such as transfer-pricing adjustments or \npermanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could harm our financial condition and operating \nresults, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition, \nthe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves \nuncertainty. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in \nour financial statements and may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. \n\n16\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to \nsignificant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. Various jurisdictions around the world \nhave enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital services taxes and other targeted taxes, which could lead to \ninconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development \ncontinues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules. \nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock \nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, \nand share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves. \nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with authorizations from the Board \nof Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase \nany specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. Further, our share repurchases could affect our share trading \nprices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a \ndecrease in the trading prices of our stock. \nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters. \nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has no voting rights. As \nof December 31, 2022, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 85.8% of our outstanding Class B stock, which \nrepresented approximately 51.2% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and \nSergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant \ncorporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because \nour Class C stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future \nstock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey’s current \nrelative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote \nof our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also affect Larry and Sergey’s relative \nvoting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and we \nmay take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could reduce the market price of our Class A stock \nand our Class C stock. \nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable. \nProvisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or \nchanges in our management. These provisions include the following: \n \nz Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the \nresignation, death, or removal of a director.\n \nz Our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding a stockholders’ \nmeeting.\n \nz Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority stockholders \nto elect director candidates.\n \nz Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to propose matters \nthat can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting \na solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company. \n \nz Our Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which makes it possible \nfor our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any \nattempt to acquire us. \nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may \nnot engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the \nstock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the transaction. Our Board of Directors could rely \non Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us. \n\n17\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nThe trading price for our Class A stock and non-voting Class C stock may continue to be volatile. \nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In addition to the factors \ndiscussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate \nwidely, in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, among others, the activities of our peers and \nchanges in broader economic and political conditions around the world. These broad market and industry factors could harm the \nmarket price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. \nGeneral Risks \nThe continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact are highly unpredictable and could be significant, and could \nharm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nOur business, operations and financial performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by the macroeconomic impacts \nresulting from COVID-19, and as a result, our revenue growth rate and expenses as a percentage of our revenues in future periods \nmay differ significantly from our historical rates, and our future operating results may fall below expectations. The extent to which \nour business will continue to be affected will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including the \npersistence of the pandemic, impacts on economic activity, and the possibility of recession or continued financial market instability. \nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short \nof expectations. \nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future fluctuate, as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control, \nincluding the cyclicality and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events. As a result, comparing our operating results (including \nour expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and our past results should not be \nrelied on as an indication of our future performance. Consequently, our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. \nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences \nthat could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, \nand these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter \ninto discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic transactions, which could create unforeseen operating difficulties \nand expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include: \n \nz diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic \ntransactions; \n \nz failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon approval \nthat could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the \nexpected financial or strategic goals of a transaction;\n \nz failure to successfully integrate the acquired operations, technologies, services, and personnel (including cultural integration and \nretention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology; \n \nz implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company; \n \nz integration of the acquired company’s accounting and other administrative systems, and the coordination of product, engineering, \nand sales and marketing functions;\n \nz transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;\n \nz in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the \nparticular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; \n \nz failure to accomplish commercial, strategic or financial objectives with respect to investments and joint ventures;\n \nz failure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity;\n \nz liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, data \nprivacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, warranty claims, product liabilities, and other \nknown and unknown liabilities; and\n \nz litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former \nstockholders, or other third parties.\n\n18\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic \ntransactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. \nOur acquisitions and other strategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of \ndebt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring \ncharges, any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Also, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions \nand other strategic transactions may not materialize. In connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, \nto provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. \nIf we were to lose the services of key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy. \nOur future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. For instance, \nSundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of Alphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development \nof our technology, maintaining our culture, and setting our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are \nat-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of key personnel could harm our business. \nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or \nmaintain and continue to adapt our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow or operate effectively. \nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our ability to compete effectively and our \nfuture success depends on our continuing to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our \norganization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted, \nand may continue to target, our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may \nnot always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Restrictive immigration \npolicy and regulatory changes may also affect our ability to hire, mobilize, or retain some of our global talent. \nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows and \nevolves, we may need to implement more complex organizational management structures or adapt our corporate culture and work \nenvironments to ever-changing circumstances, such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, and these changes could \naffect our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate culture. As we experiment with hybrid work \nmodels, we may experience increased costs and/or disruption, in addition to potential effects on our ability to operate effectively \nand maintain our corporate culture.\n\n19\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 4  MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\n\t\n—\nITEM 1B.\tUNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\n\t\n—\nITEM 2.\t PROPERTIES\nOur headquarters are located in Mountain View, California.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, \nRELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER \nPURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nAs of October 2, 2015, Alphabet Inc. became the successor issuer of Google Inc. pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act. \nOur Class A stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG” since August 19, 2004 and under the \nsymbol “GOOGL” since April 3, 2014. Prior to August 19, 2004, there was no public market for our stock. Our Class B stock is neither \nlisted nor traded. Our Class C stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG” since April 3, 2014.\nHolders of Record\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 6,670 and 1,657 stockholders of record of our Class A stock and Class C stock, \nrespectively. Because many of our shares of Class A stock and Class C stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of \nstockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.

We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google \nCloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 \n“Business” and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue \nto affect our future results:\n \nz Users’ behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\nThe continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since inception. \nWe expect that this shift to an online world will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower pace than \nwe have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our advertising revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nIn addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, which may affect our revenues.\n \nz Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which allows for new advertising \nformats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\nOur users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables, and smart home devices, \nand want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products \nand services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats. The \nmargins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. Additionally, \nas the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues may be affected. For example, growth in the \nglobal smartphone market has slowed due to various factors, including increased market saturation in developed countries, which \ncan affect our mobile advertising revenues.\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and TAC as a \npercentage of our advertising revenues (“TAC rate”) to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix; partner mix; partner \nagreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product mix; the relative revenue growth rates \nof advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\n \nz As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our monetization.\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand our product \nofferings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. For example, revenues from ads on YouTube and \nGoogle Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also may develop new products incorporating AI innovations \nthat could affect our monetization trends. Additionally, when developing new products and services we generally focus first on user \nexperience before prioritizing monetization.\n \nz As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase, \nand may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues.\nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., including in emerging \nmarkets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and advertising programs relevant \nto our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased revenues from emerging markets. We expect that our results will \n\n24\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\ncontinue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This \ntrend could affect our revenues as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange \nrates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to \nthese fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\n \nz The revenues that we derive from non-advertising products and services are increasing and may adversely affect our margins.\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our products and \nservices. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins on our advertising revenues. \nIn particular margins on our hardware products adversely affect our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher \ncost of sales.\n \nz As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to develop new, \ninnovative offerings and improve our existing offerings across our businesses. We also expect to continue to invest in our technical \ninfrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term \ninitiatives, in particular in support of AI. In addition acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our \nofferings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives. \nFor example, in September 2022 we closed the acquisition of Mandiant to help expand our offerings in dynamic cyber defense \nand response. \n \nz We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our business practices \nand financial results.\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and \nrelated legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our \ncost of doing business may increase, our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be \nlimited, and we may need to change our business practices. Examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department \nof Justice and a number of state Attorneys General; pending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or \neliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms; and the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in Europe and \nvarious legislative proposals in the U.S. focused on large technology platforms. For additional information see Item 1A Risk Factors \nand Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.\n \nz Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees \naround the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional information see Culture and Workforce in Part I, \nItem 1 “Business.”\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers \nof all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and \nservices, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products. For details on how \nwe recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on \nForm 10-K.\nIn addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business noted above, fluctuations in our revenues have been \nand may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including:\n \nz changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n \nz changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives;\n \nz general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and \ntheir effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; \n \nz new product and service launches; and\n \nz seasonality.\nAdditionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (“Google advertising”), revenues from other sources (“Google \nother revenues”), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues have been and may continue to be affected by other factors unique to each \nset of revenues, as described below.\n\n25\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGOOGLE SERVICES\nGoogle Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google other revenues.\nGoogle Advertising\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following: \n \nz Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated \nby search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned \nand operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n \nz YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\n \nz Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google \nAd Manager.\nWe use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues: paid \nclicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while impressions and cost-per-impression pertain \nto traffic on our Google Network properties.\nPaid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search properties and \nother Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven \nrevenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement \nby users.\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and \nGoogle Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of \nimpressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the \nnumber of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and \nimpression activity.\nFluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search & other properties \nand the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have \nbeen and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as:\n \nz advertiser competition for keywords;\n \nz changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;\n \nz changes in device mix; \n \nz seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail \nseasonality; and\n \nz traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels.\nGoogle Other\nGoogle other revenues are comprised of the following:\n \nz Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases;\n \nz hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices;\n \nz YouTube non-advertising, which includes subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV; and\n \nz other products and services.\nFluctuations in our Google other revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as changes in \ncustomer usage and demand, number of subscribers, and fluctuations in the timing of product launches.\nGOOGLE CLOUD\nGoogle Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:\n \nz Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;\n \nz Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail, \nDocs, Drive, Calendar and Meet; and \n \nz other enterprise services.\nFluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as customer usage.\n\n26\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOTHER BETS\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\nCosts and Expenses \nOur cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to \nR&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated \nwith the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in \nnature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. \nCOST OF REVENUES\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n \nz TAC includes:\n \nz Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners \ninclude browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers.\n \nz Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n \nz Other cost of revenues includes:\n \nz Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution \non YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee).\n \nz Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other \nequipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs).\n \nz Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell.\nTAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a \npercentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues \nfrom ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&D, sales and \nmarketing, or general and administrative.\nThe main components of our R&D expenses are:\n \nz compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing and new products \nand services; \n \nz depreciation; and\n \nz third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and product \ndevelopment efforts.\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\n \nz compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions; and\n \nz spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\n \nz compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other administrative \nsupport functions; \n \nz expenses relating to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and \n \nz third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative services.\nOther Income (Expense), Net \nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains (losses), \nnet gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, and income (loss) and \nimpairment from our equity method investments.\n\n27\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor additional details, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in the value of our \ninvestments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report \non Form 10-K as well as Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred in the U.S. and the \nmany jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are \nconsidered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.\nFor additional details, including a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate, see Note 14 of the Notes \nto Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nExecutive Overview\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated financial results (in millions, except for per share information and percentages):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021\n2022\n$ Change\n% Change\nConsolidated revenues\n$\n257,637\n$\n282,836\n$\n25,199\n10%\nChange in consolidated constant currency revenues(1)\n14%\nCost of revenues\n$\n110,939\n$\n126,203\n$\n15,264\n14%\nOperating expenses\n$\n67,984\n$\n81,791\n$\n13,807\n20%\nOperating income\n$\n78,714\n$\n74,842\n$\n(3,872)\n(5)%\nOperating margin\n31%\n26%\n(5)%\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n12,020\n$\n(3,514)\n$\n(15,534)\n(129)%\nNet income\n$\n76,033\n$\n59,972\n$\n(16,061)\n(21)%\nDiluted EPS\n$\n5.61\n$\n4.56\n$\n(1.05)\n(19)%\n(1)\t See “Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Measures” below for details relating to our use of constant currency information. \n \nz Revenues were $282.8 billion, an increase of 10% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in Google Services revenues of \n$16.0 billion, or 7%, and an increase in Google Cloud revenues of $7.1 billion, or 37%.\n \nz Total constant currency revenues, which exclude the effect of hedging, increased 14% year over year.\n \nz Cost of revenues was $126.2 billion, an increase of 14% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in other costs of revenues.\n \nz Operating expenses were $81.8 billion, an increase of 20% year over year, primarily driven by increases in compensation expenses \ndue to headcount growth, third-party service fees, and advertising and promotional expenses.\nOther information:\n \nz On September 12, 2022, we closed the acquisition of Mandiant for a total purchase price of $6.1 billion and added more than \n2,600 employees.

The ongoing effect of these direct actions on our financial results was not material. The \nbroader economic effects resulting from the war in Ukraine on our future financial results may be unpredictable.\n \nz Repurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $59.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 11 of the Notes to \nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n \nz Operating cash flow was $91.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n \nz Capital expenditures, which primarily reflected investments in technical infrastructure, were $31.5 billion for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022.\n \nz As of December 31, 2022, we had 190,234 employees.\nAdditionally, looking ahead to fiscal year 2023:\n \nz In January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce of approximately 12,000 roles. We expect to incur employee severance \nand related charges of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, the majority of which will be recognized in the first quarter of 2023.\nIn addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As a result we expect to incur exit costs relating to office \nspace reductions of approximately $0.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023. We may incur additional charges in the future as we \nfurther evaluate our real estate needs.\n \nz In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment, resulting in a change \nin the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years, which we expect to result in a reduction \nof depreciation of approximately $3.4 billion for the full fiscal year 2023 for assets in service as of December 31, 2022, recorded \nprimarily in cost of revenues and R&D expenses. \n \nz As AI is critical to delivering our mission of bringing our breakthrough innovations into the real world, beginning in January 2023, we \nwill update our segment reporting relating to certain of Alphabet’s AI activities. DeepMind, previously reported within Other Bets, will \nbe reported as part of Alphabet’s corporate costs, reflecting its increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and \nOther Bets.

The growth was driven by interrelated factors including \nincreases in search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices; growth in advertiser \nspending; and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery. Growth was adversely affected by the unfavorable effect of \nforeign currency exchange rates.\nYouTube ads\nYouTube ads revenues increased $398 million from 2021 to 2022. The growth was driven by our brand advertising products followed \nby direct response products, both of which benefited from increased spending by our advertisers as well as improvements to ad \nformats and delivery. Growth was adversely affected by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.\nGoogle Network\nGoogle Network revenues increased $1.1 billion from 2021 to 2022. The growth was primarily driven by strength in AdSense and \nAdMob. Growth was adversely affected by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.\nMONETIZATION METRICS\nPaid clicks and cost-per-click\nThe following table presents changes in paid clicks and cost-per-click (expressed as a percentage) from 2021 to 2022:\nPaid clicks change\n10%\nCost-per-click change\n\t\n(1)%\nPaid clicks increased from 2021 to 2022 driven by a number of interrelated factors, including an increase in search queries resulting \nfrom growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices; growth in advertiser spending; and improvements we have \nmade in ad formats and delivery.\nCost-per-click decreased from 2021 to 2022 driven by a number of interrelated factors including changes in device mix, geographic mix, \nadvertiser spending, ongoing product changes, and property mix, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.\nImpressions and cost-per-impression\nThe following table presents changes in impressions and cost-per-impression (expressed as a percentage) from 2021 to 2022:\nImpressions change\n3 %\nCost-per-impression change\n1%\nImpressions increased from 2021 to 2022 primarily driven by Google Ad Manager and AdMob.

The growth in YouTube non-advertising was largely due to an increase \nin paid subscribers. The growth in hardware was primarily driven by increased sales of Pixel devices. The decrease in Google Play \nrevenues was primarily driven by the fee structure changes we announced in 2021 as well as a decrease in buyer spending.

We \nuse non-GAAP constant currency revenues (“constant currency revenues”) and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency \nrevenues (“percentage change in constant currency revenues”) for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to \nevaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally \nAccepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the \neffects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. \nWe define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (“FX Effect”) as well \nas hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant \ncurrency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period \nrevenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year \ncomparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period \nexchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a \nconstant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are \nnot a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\n31\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents the foreign exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues (in millions, except percentages):\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\n% Change from Prior Period\nYear Ended December 31,\nLess FX \nEffect\nConstant \nCurrency \nRevenues\nAs \nReported\nLess \nHedging \nEffect\nLess FX \nEffect\nConstant \nCurrency \nRevenues\n2021\n2022\nUnited States\n$ 117,854\n$ 134,814 $\n0\n$ 134,814\n14%\n0%\n14%\nEMEA\n79,107\n82,062\n(8,979)\n91,041\n4%\n(11)%\n15%\nAPAC\n46,123\n47,024\n(3,915)\n50,939\n2%\n(8)%\n10%\nOther Americas\n14,404\n16,976\n(430)\n17,406\n18%\n(3)%\n21%\nRevenues, excluding hedging effect\n257,488\n280,876\n(13,324)\n294,200\n9%\n(5)%\n14%\nHedging gains (losses)\n149\n1,960\nTotal revenues(1)\n$ 257,637\n$ 282,836\n$ 294,200\n10%\n1%\n(5)%\n14%\n(1)\t Total constant currency revenues of $294.2 billion for 2022 increased $36.7 billion compared to $257.5 billion in revenues, excluding hedging effect \nfor 2021.\nEMEA revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar \nstrengthening relative to the Euro and the British pound.\nAPAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar \nstrengthening relative to the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar.\nOther Americas growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar \nstrengthening relative to the Argentine peso.\nCosts and Expenses\nCOST OF REVENUES\nThe following table presents cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, except percentages):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021\n2022\nTAC\n$\n45,566\n$\n48,955\nOther cost of revenues\n65,373\n77,248\nTotal cost of revenues\n$\n110,939\n$\n126,203\nTotal cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues\n43%\n45%\nCost of revenues increased $15.3 billion from 2021 to 2022.

Additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; \nand licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings and subscription-based products.\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network partners, to employees for \ncompensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities include payments to suppliers for hardware, \nto tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased from 2021 to 2022 primarily due to the net effect of an increase in cash received \nfrom revenues, offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses and an increase in tax payments driven \nby the effects of capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses beginning in 2022 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nCASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and non-marketable \nsecurities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and non-marketable securities, purchases \nof property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased from 2021 to 2022 as a result of a decrease in net purchases of and maturities and \nsales of marketable securities, partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment.\nCASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of interest in \nconsolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net payments related to stock-based \naward activities, and repayments of debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from 2021 to 2022 primarily due to an increase in repurchases of stock.\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and financing activities to \ncontinue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the \nnext 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASES\nWe make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets through purchases of \nproperty and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products. \nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\n \nz technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage, and networking \nrequirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to as our information technology assets) and data \ncenter land and building construction; and\n \nz office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as “fit-outs”).\nConstruction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been placed in service. \nThe time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months to years. For example, our \ndata center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple phases, where we acquire qualified land and buildings, \nconstruct buildings, and secure and install information technology assets. \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, we spent $24.6 billion and $31.5 billion on capital expenditures, respectively. \nDepreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our \nintended use.

As of December 31, 2022, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, which had a weighted \naverage remaining lease term of 8 years, was $17.4 billion, of which $3.0 billion is short-term. As of December 31, 2022, we have entered \ninto leases that have not yet commenced with future short-term and long-term lease payments of $630 million and $3.1 billion that \nare not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2023 and 2026 with non-cancelable \nlease terms of 1 to 25 years.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs) were $3.4 billion and \n$3.7 billion, respectively.

See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial \nStatements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our debt.\nWe primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure and hardware products \nwe sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then supply these components to \ncontract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and hardware products. Certain of these arrangements result in a \nportion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be presented as financing activities in the Consolidated \nStatements of Cash Flows included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on From 10-K.\nSHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM\nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its Class A and \nClass C shares. As of December 31, 2022, $28.1 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases. In accordance \nwith the authorization of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, during 2022 we repurchased and subsequently retired 530 million shares \nfor $59.3 billion. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired, 61 million shares were Class A stock for $6.7 billion \nand 469 million shares were Class C stock for $52.6 billion. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included \nin Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEUROPEAN COMMISSION FINES\nIn 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition law \nand imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018), and €1.5 billion \n($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the 2018 fine from €4.3 billion \nto €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the European Court of Justice. In 2018 we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for \nthe fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022. \nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated \nBalance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For further details, see Note 10 of the Notes \nto Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTAXES\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had short-term and long-term income taxes payable of $1.6 billion and $4.2 billion related to a one-time \ntransition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”). As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay \nthe transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have taxes payable of $5.1 billion primarily related to \nuncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022. \n\n36\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPURCHASE COMMITMENTS \nAs of December 31, 2022, we had material non-cancelable contractual obligations of $32.0 billion, of which $17.3 billion was short-term. \nThese amounts represent the non-cancelable portion of agreements or the minimum cancellation fee and are primarily related to \ncommitments to purchase licenses, technical infrastructure, inventory, and network capacity. For those agreements with variable \nterms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of December 31, 2022.\nIn addition we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and energy attributes, such \nas renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar commitment. The amounts to be paid under \nthese agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily determinable.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions. \nOur critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was \nmade, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of \noperations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and \nother assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. \nWe have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary \nof significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.\nFair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-marketable equity \nsecurities. These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method (“the measurement alternative”) and \nare measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments resulting from observable price changes \nfor identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments require quantitative assessments of the fair value of \nour securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs. Pricing adjustments are determined by using various valuation \nmethodologies and involve the use of estimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or \nother available market data.\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the companies’ financial \nand liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative \nmeasurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach, which requires judgment \nand the use of unobservable inputs, including discount rates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and \npublic companies, among others. When the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down \nthe investment to its current fair value.\nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e. performance fees. \nWe record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in expense recognized \nbefore investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobservable inputs.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when other changes occur, \nsuch as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use and utilization of assets, or technological \nadvancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we expect to benefit from the assets. \nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax \npositions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of comparable and resolved \ntax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain tax positions periodically, considering \nchanges in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by \ntaxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that \nthe final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than \nthe amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which \nsuch determination is made.\n\n37\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate \nas well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns \nby the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the \nlikelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision \nfor income taxes.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders \ninvolving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial \ndisputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal \ninjury consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate \namounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be \nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose \nthe possible loss in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously \naccrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures \nas appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the estimated amount of a loss related to such \nmatters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such \namounts could be material. \nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment, resulting in a change in the \nestimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years, which we expect to result in a reduction of depreciation \nof approximately $3.4 billion for the full fiscal year 2023 for assets in service as of December 31, 2022, recorded primarily in cost of \nrevenues and R&D expenses. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report \non Form 10-K for information relating to the useful lives of our servers and network equipment.\n\n38\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7A  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\t\n—\nITEM 7A.\tQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES \nABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity investment risks.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. International revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign \ncurrencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Principal currencies hedged \nincluded the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen. For the purpose of analyzing foreign currency \nexchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible \nthat adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be experienced.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities denominated \nin currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts reduce, but do not entirely \neliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and \nlosses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are offset by the gains and losses on the \nforward and option contracts.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets, liabilities, and commitments \ndenominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have resulted in an adverse effect \non income before income taxes of approximately $285 million and $136 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, \nafter consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased \nand written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. When the \nU.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option contacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our \nearnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign currency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains \nrelated to our earnings. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate \nmovements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign \ncurrency spot rate changes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them \ninto revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur. \nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our cash flow \nhedges before tax effect would have been approximately $1.3 billion lower for both December 31, 2021 and 2022. The change in \nthe value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues \nwhen recognized.\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to \ninvestment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign \noperations.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI related to our net \ninvestment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $975 million and $903 million lower as of December 31, 2021 \nand 2022, respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency translation \ngain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity. We invest \nprimarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, \nmoney market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate derivatives. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any \none issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed \nrate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may \nproduce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily \ndue to interest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt \nsecurities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. We \nmeasure securities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the \nsecurities are sold, less any expected credit losses. \n\n39\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7A  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of our marketable \ndebt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our investment portfolio due to \nadverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with 95% confidence interval. The estimated one-day \nloss in fair value of marketable debt securities as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 are shown below (in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n12-Month Average \nAs of December 31,\n2021\n2022\n2021\n2022\nRisk category - interest rate\n$\n139\n$\n256\n$\n148\n$\n198\nActual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity \nanalyses performed as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and \namount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is not intended to represent actual losses \nbut is used as a risk estimation.\nEquity Investment Risk\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially \nreduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are investments in \nprivately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable \nmarket values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and represent $7.8 billion and \n$5.2 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. A hypothetical adverse price change of 10% on our \nDecember 31, 2022 balance would decrease the fair value of marketable equity securities by $516 million. From time to time, we \nmay enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for observable transactions \nfor identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative). The fair value \nmeasured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an indication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet \ndate. These investments, especially those that are in the early stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products \nthese companies have under development are typically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a \ndecline in financial condition, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. Valuations \nof our equity investments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and \nobservable transactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses. In addition, global economic conditions could result in \nadditional volatility. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability \nto realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public offerings, acquisitions, private sales or other \nmarket events. Changes in the valuation of non-marketable equity securities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of \nmarketable equity securities. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which \nwere accounted for under the measurement alternative, was $27.6 billion and $28.5 billion, respectively. \nThe carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, \ngenerally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, these investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds \nthe fair value and is not expected to recover.\nFor further information about our equity investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \nincluded in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n40\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\t\n—\nITEM 8.\t FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY \nDATA\nAlphabet Inc.\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPage\nREPORTS OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (PCAOB ID: 42)\b\n41\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\b\n44\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\b\n45\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\b\n46\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\b\n47\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\b\n48\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\b\n49\n\n41\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alphabet Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and \n2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the \nthree years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at \nItem 15 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements \npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2022, and the results of its \noperations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally \naccepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) \n(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal \nControl—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), \nand our report dated February 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the \nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required \nto be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and \nregulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the \naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to \nerror or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, \nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a \ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the \naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the \nfinancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was \ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are \nmaterial to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication \nof the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we \nare not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account \nor disclosure to which it relates. \n\n42\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES\nDescription \nof the Matter\nThe Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other \nproceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax \nand related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by its users, goods \nand services offered by advertisers or publishers using their platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, \nand other matters. As described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements “Commitments and \ncontingencies” such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and \nconsent orders could result in adverse consequences.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood, and the estimated amount, of a loss related \nto such matters. Auditing management’s accounting for and disclosure of loss contingencies from these \nmatters involved challenging and subjective auditor judgment in assessing the Company’s evaluation of the \nprobability of a loss, and the estimated amount or range of loss.\nHow We Addressed \nthe Matter in \nOur Audit\nWe tested relevant controls over the identified risks associated with management’s accounting for and \ndisclosure of these matters. This included controls over management’s assessment of the probability of \nincurrence of a loss and whether the loss or range of loss was reasonably estimable and the development \nof related disclosures.\nOur audit procedures included gaining an understanding of previous rulings issued by regulators and the \nstatus of ongoing lawsuits, reviewing letters addressing the matters from internal and external legal counsel, \nmeeting with internal legal counsel to discuss the allegations, and obtaining a representation letter from \nmanagement on these matters. We also evaluated the Company’s disclosures in relation to these matters.\n/S/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1999.\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 2, 2023\n\n43\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Alphabet Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 \nframework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Alphabet Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal \ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), \nthe 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion \nthereon. \nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment \nof the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal \nControl over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting \nbased on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to \nthe Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and \nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit \nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness \nexists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing \nsuch other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for \nour opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability \nof financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted \naccounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain \nto the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets \nof the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial \nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being \nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance \nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a \nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections \nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes \nin conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 2, 2023\n\n44\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1.\t Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, \nwe implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (“Alphabet”) became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers \nwith infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, \nsuch as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable \ninterest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that \naffect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ \nmaterially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the \nallowance for credit losses; fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets, and goodwill; inventory; useful lives of intangible \nassets and property and equipment; income taxes; and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, \nboth historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments \nabout the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated \nuseful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from five years to \nsix years. This change in accounting estimate is effective beginning in fiscal year 2023. \nStock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (“Stock Split”)\nOn February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-for-one stock split in the \nform of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company’s Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. The Stock Split had \na record date of July 1, 2022 and an effective date of July 15, 2022. The par value per share of our Class A, Class B, and Class C \nstock remains unchanged at $0.001 per share after the Stock Split. All prior period references made to share or per share amounts \nin the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures prior to the effective date have been retroactively \nadjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an \namount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from revenues. \nADVERTISING REVENUES\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\n \nz Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.\ncom as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, \nand Google Play;\n \nz YouTube properties; and\n \nz Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google \nAd Manager.\n\n50\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, and Google Marketing Platform, \namong others.\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for performance advertising \nwhen a user engages with the advertisement, such as a click, a view, or a purchase. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues \nwhen the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or \nagent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on \na gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners \nare recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our \ncustomers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers \nand is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\nGOOGLE CLOUD REVENUES\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\n \nz Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;\n \nz Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail, \nDocs, Drive, Calendar, and Meet; and \n \nz other enterprise services.\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract terms longer than a \nyear. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when the customer utilizes the services, \nbased on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized \nratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services.\nGOOGLE OTHER REVENUES \nGoogle other revenues consist of revenues from:\n \nz Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases;\n \nz hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices;\n \nz YouTube non-advertising, which includes subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV; and\n \nz other products and services.\nWe report revenues from Google Play app sales and in-app purchases on a net basis, because our performance obligation is to \nfacilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a service fee. \nARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenues to each \nperformance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on \nthe prices charged to customers.\nCUSTOMER INCENTIVES AND CREDITS\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these \namounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that there will not be significant \nchanges to our estimates of variable consideration.\nSALES COMMISSIONS\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the amortization period (the period of the expected benefit) is one year or \nless. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions if we expect the period of benefit of these costs to exceed one year and \nrecognize the expense over the amortization period. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\n\n51\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n \nz TAC includes: \n \nz Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners \ninclude browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers.\n \nz Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n \nz Other cost of revenues includes:\n \nz Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for \ndistribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee).\n \nz Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other \nequipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs).\n \nz Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to \nbe sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological feasibility is typically reached \nshortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material \nfor the periods presented.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud-based \napplications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary \nproject stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function \nintended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity classified and measured at \nthe fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense using the straight-line attribution method \nover the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf \nof our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and the income tax withholding is \nrecorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nAdditionally, stock-based compensation includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include \nmarket conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bets. PSUs and certain Other Bet awards \nare equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Certain Other Bet awards are liability classified and \nremeasured at fair value through settlement. The fair value of Other Bet awards is based on the equity valuation of the respective \nOther Bet.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, \nand 2022, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $5.4 billion, $7.9 billion, and $9.2 billion, respectively.\nPerformance Fees\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments. We record \ncompensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in expense recognized before \ninvestment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobservable inputs. Performance fees are \nrecorded as a component of other income (expense), net.\n\n52\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nFair Value Measurements \nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly \ntransaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions \nthat market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and \nclassified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used \nto measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar \ninstruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable \nin the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and \ndiscount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign \nexchange rates, and credit ratings.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs \nwhen measuring fair value. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation methods and relevant inputs \ninto valuation models.\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, marketable securities, \nderivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets measured at fair value on a \nnonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and liabilities are carried at cost with fair value \ndisclosed, if required.\nWe measure certain other instruments, including stock-based compensation awards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets, and \ncertain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. \nFinancial Instruments\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative financial instruments \nand accounts receivable.\nCREDIT RISKS\nWe are subject to credit risk from cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments, including foreign \nexchange contracts, and accounts receivable. We manage our credit risk exposure through timely assessment of our counterparty \ncreditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial \ninstitutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from \ncustomers located around the world. We manage our credit risk exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer \ncredit and we limit the amount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers.\nCASH EQUIVALENTS\nWe invest excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, \ntime deposits, and money market funds.\nMARKETABLE SECURITIES\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash \nequivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance \nSheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt securities at the time of purchase and \nreevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as \navailable-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt \nsecurities prior to their effective maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly \nliquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated \nBalance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of \nstockholders’ equity, except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded in other income (expense), \nnet. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value are recorded in other \nincome (expense), net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a specific identification \nmethod, and we record such gains and losses as a component of other income (expense), net.\n\n53\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nOur investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses, including unrealized, \nrecognized in other income (expense), net. We classify our marketable equity securities subject to long-term lock-up restrictions \nbeyond twelve months as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNON-MARKETABLE SECURITIES\nWe account for non-marketable equity securities through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the \ninvestee under the equity method, All other non-marketable equity securities that we hold are primarily accounted for under the \nmeasurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or \nminus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. \nAdjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are recorded as a component of \nother income (expense), net.\nNon-marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.\nNon-marketable securities that do not have effective contractual maturity dates are classified as other non-current assets on the \nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nSee Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments. \nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\nOur payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or services offered. \nThe term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customers, we require \npayment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. Additionally, accounts receivable includes amounts for \nservices performed in advance of the right to invoice the customer.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable, and changes \nin such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We assess collectibility by \nreviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify \nspecific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we \nconsider historical collectibility based on past due status and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based \non ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider customer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and \nsupportable forecasts of future economic conditions.\nOTHER\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also have commercial arrangements. \nFor these transactions, judgment is required to assess the substance of the arrangements, whether the arrangements and each \ncomponent of the arrangements should be accounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP, as well as the \ndetermination of the value of the components of the arrangements, including the fair value of the investments. \nIMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENTS\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment. \nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is estimated by considering \navailable information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable \nand supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to other income (expense), net, not to exceed the amount of the \nunrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If we have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely \nthan not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we \nwill write down the security to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as a component of other income (expense), net. \nFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment indicators exist by \nevaluating the companies’ financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among other indicators. If the assessment \nindicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value by recording the corresponding charge as a \ncomponent of other income (expense), net. We prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using \na market approach or an income approach.\n\n54\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nInventory\nInventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is computed using \nthe first-in, first-out method.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other \nvariable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are the primary beneficiary. We are the \nprimary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect the economic performance \nof the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, \nwe account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the \nentity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. \nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets, construction in progress, \nleasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices, data centers, and related building \nimprovements. Information technology assets include servers and network equipment. Construction in progress is the construction \nor development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service. \nWe account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. We compute depreciation using the straight-line \nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate. Land is not depreciated. We depreciate buildings over \nperiods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets generally over periods of four to five years (generally, four \nyears for servers and five years for network equipment). We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease \nterm or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation for buildings, information technology assets, leasehold improvements, \nand furniture and fixtures commences once they are ready for our intended use.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. \nPayments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance \nand utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and account for them together as a single \nlease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and \nliabilities. These amounts include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on wind or solar production \nfor power purchase arrangements, and payments for maintenance and utilities.\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The \ninterest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest \nrate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on \na collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease \nterms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. \nWe generally use the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include \nany prepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our operating lease \nliabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is included in operating lease liabilities. \nFinance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and \nother current liabilities or long-term debt.\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n55\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nLong-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe review property and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances \nindicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows \nindependent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted \ncash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not \nrecoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Impairments \nwere not material for the periods presented.\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting \nunits periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill \nusing a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or \nchanges in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis generally over periods \nranging from one to twelve years, and are subsequently removed from the presentation of gross intangible assets and accumulated \namortization once they are fully amortized.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable \nfor the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in \nour financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted \ntax law. We evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to \nreduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects \nof the global intangible low tax Income provision as a current period expense.\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical merits, the position \nwill be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based \non the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we \nrecognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of \nthe acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, except for revenue contracts \nacquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The excess of the purchase price over the fair \nvalues of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the \nbusiness combination and are expensed as incurred.\nForeign Currency\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets \nand liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for revenues, costs, and expenses. \nWe record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders’ equity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction \ngains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency \nexchange gain (loss) in other income (expense), net.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n\n56\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nNote 2.\t Revenues\nDisaggregated Revenues\nThe following table presents revenues disaggregated by type (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020\n2021\n2022\nGoogle Search & other\n$\n104,062\n$\n148,951\n$\n162,450\nYouTube ads\n19,772\n28,845\n29,243\nGoogle Network\n23,090\n31,701\n32,780\nGoogle advertising\n146,924\n209,497\n224,473\nGoogle other\n21,711\n28,032\n29,055\nGoogle Services total\n168,635\n237,529\n253,528\nGoogle Cloud\n13,059\n19,206\n26,280\nOther Bets\n657\n753\n1,068\nHedging gains (losses)\n176\n149\n1,960\nTotal revenues\n$\n182,527\n$\n257,637\n$\n282,836\nNo individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2020, 2021, or 2022.\nThe following table presents revenues disaggregated by geography, based on the addresses of our customers (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020\n2021\n2022\nUnited States\n$\n85,014\n47 %\n$\n117,854\n46 %\n$\n134,814\n48%\nEMEA(1)\n55,370\n30\n79,107\n31\n82,062\n29\nAPAC(1)\n32,550\n18\n46,123\n18\n47,024\n16\nOther Americas(1)\n9,417\n5\n14,404\n5\n16,976\n6\nHedging gains (losses)\n176\n0\n149\n0\n1,960\n1\nTotal revenues\n$\n182,527\n100%\n$\n257,637\n100 %\n$\n282,836\n100%\n(1)\t Regions represent Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Asia-Pacific (APAC); and Canada and Latin America (“Other Americas”).\nRevenue Backlog \nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $64.3 billion of remaining performance obligations (“revenue backlog”), primarily related to Google \nCloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as \nrevenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance \nwith relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when \nwe expect to recognize such as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next \n24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded \nas well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less \nand cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenue\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are \nrefundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other.

The primary risk managed is foreign \nexchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries \nwill be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset \nour exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within \nLevel 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to \nrevenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge \neffectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between \nfair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $171 million, \nwhich is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\nFAIR VALUE HEDGES\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our marketable securities \ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness \nare recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items.

These VIEs include private companies that are primarily \nearly stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources. \nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly \naffect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position \nof these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments as non-marketable equity \nsecurities or equity method investments.\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any \nfuture funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investments \nin them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs were $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, as \nof December 31, 2021 and $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.\n\n67\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nNote 6.\t Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper.

We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from \na breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. \nSeveral of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, \nwe have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification \nobligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to \nthe unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the payments we have made under such \nagreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the \nextent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material \nadverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. \nAs of December 31, 2022, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible.\nLegal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. \nIf we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible \nloss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and \nthe matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. Significant judgment is required to \ndetermine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be unable \nto estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are inherently unpredictable \nand subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nANTITRUST INVESTIGATIONS\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC’s Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints \nagainst us. \nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping \nsearch results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) \nfine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented \nproduct changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC’s decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine \nin the second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal \nwith the European Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution agreements infringed \nEuropean competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of \nthe conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain \nof our Android distribution practices. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We \nsubsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which \nwe reduced by $217 million in 2022.\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AdSense for \nSearch partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) \nand directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners’ agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, \nwe appealed the EC decision, which remains pending. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n73\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition matters by regulatory \nauthorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. For example:\n \nz In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting information \nand documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of state \nAttorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search \nadvertising. Further, in June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom’s \nCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\n \nz On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising \ntechnology. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint \nalleging that Google’s digital advertising technology products violate U.S. antitrust laws. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each \nopened a formal investigation into Google’s advertising technology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and \nJune 29, 2022, respectively.\n \nz On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District \nof California, alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and \nconsumer protection laws. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play’s business practices. \nKorean regulators are investigating Google Play’s billing practices, most recently opening a formal review in May 2022 of Google’s \ncompliance with the new app store billing regulations.\nWe believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate with federal and state \nregulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPATENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our \nproducts, services, and technologies infringe others’ intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards \nof substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, \nfunctionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices and develop non-infringing products \nor technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International \nTrade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate \nloss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, \na prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products \ninto the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain intellectual \nproperty infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay \nsignificant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the \nuse of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and \nadversely affect our business.\nOTHER\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving \ncompetition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial \ndisputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal \ninjury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we currently have a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits \nongoing in multiple jurisdictions. We also periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. \nSuch claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders could result in substantial \nfines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations \nto our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm \nour business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding penalties have been \nimposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of sanctioned parties. We do \nnot believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\n\n74\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nNon-Income Taxes \nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter \nof non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and \nservices in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from \nexaminations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we \ndetermine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible \nloss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome \nmay be materially different from our expectations.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies see Note 14.\nNote 11.\tStockholders’ Equity \nClass A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C capital stock. The rights \nof the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Each share of Class A \ncommon stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital \nstock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at \nthe option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\nStock Split\nOn July 15, 2022, the company executed a 20-for-one stock split with a record date of July 1, 2022, effected in the form of a one-time \nspecial stock dividend on each share of the company’s Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. All prior period references made to share \nor per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively \nadjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. See Note 1 for further details. \nShare Repurchases\nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C \nshares. As of December 31, 2022, $28.1 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases. \nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2021\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nShares\nAmount\nShares\nAmount\nClass A share repurchases\n24\n$\n3,399\n61\n$\n6,719\nClass C share repurchases\n383\n46,875\n469\n52,577\nTotal share repurchases\n407\n$\n50,274\n530\n$\n59,296\nClass A and Class C shares are repurchased in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking \ninto account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A \nand Class C shares. Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other \ninvestment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. \nThe repurchase program does not have an expiration date.\n\n75\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nNote 12.\tNet Income Per Share \nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is \ncomputed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed \nusing the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially \ndilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted \nstock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock \nmethod. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A stock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the \ndiluted net income per share of Class B stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock are identical, except \nwith respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware \nlaw, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A, Class B, and \nClass C stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect \nof adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely \naffected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may \nbe put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors. As a result, the undistributed \nearnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A, Class B, and Class C stock as if \nthe earnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are \nallocated on a proportionate basis.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A, Class B, and \nClass C stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance \nwith the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.\nThe following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock \n(in millions, except per share amounts):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020\nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\nBasic net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings \n$\n17,733\n$\n2,732\n$\n19,804\nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n5,996 \n924 \n6,696 \nBasic net income per share\n$\n2.96\n$\n2.96\n$\n2.96\nDiluted net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation \n$\n17,733\n$\n2,732\n$\n19,804\nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B to \nClass A shares\n2,732 \n0 \n0 \nReallocation of undistributed earnings\n(180)\n(25)\n180 \nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$\n20,285\n$\n2,707\n$\n19,984\nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in basic computation\n5,996 \n924 \n6,696 \nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities\nAdd:\nConversion of Class B to Class A shares outstanding\n924 \n0 \n0 \nRestricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares\n2 \n0 \n123\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n6,922 \n924 \n6,819\nDiluted net income per share\n$\n2.93\n$\n2.93\n$\n2.93\n\n76\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021\nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\nBasic net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$\n34,200\n$\n5,174\n$\n36,659\nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n6,006 \n909 \n6,438 \nBasic net income per share\n$\n5.69\n$\n5.69\n$\n5.69\nDiluted net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation\n$\n34,200\n$\n5,174\n$\n36,659\nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A \nshares\n5,174 \n0 \n0 \nReallocation of undistributed earnings\n(581)\n(77)\n581 \nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$\n38,793\n$\n5,097\n$\n37,240\nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in basic computation\n6,006 \n909 \n6,438 \nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities\nAdd:\nConversion of Class B to Class A shares outstanding\n909 \n0 \n0 \nRestricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares\n0 \n0 \n200 \nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n6,915\n909\n6,638\nDiluted net income per share\n$\n5.61\n$\n5.61 \n$\n5.61 \nYear Ended December 31,\n2022\nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\nBasic net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$\n27,518\n$\n4,072\n$\n28,382\nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n5,994\n887\n6,182\nBasic net income per share\n$\n4.59\n$\n4.59\n$\n4.59\nDiluted net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation\n$\n27,518\n$\n4,072\n$\n28,382\nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B to \nClass A shares\n4,072\n0 \n0 \nReallocation of undistributed earnings\n(230)\n(30)\n230 \nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$\n31,360\n$\n4,042\n$\n28,612\nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in basic computation\n5,994\n887\n6,182\nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities\nAdd:\nConversion of Class B to Class A shares outstanding\n887\n0 \n0 \nRestricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares\n0\n0 \n96\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n6,881\n887\n6,278\nDiluted net income per share\n$\n4.56\n$\n4.56\n$\n4.56\n\n77\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nNote 13.\tCompensation Plans\nStock Plans\nOur stock plans include the Alphabet Amended and Restated 2021 Stock Plan (“Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan”) and Other Bet stock-based \nplans.

If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in \n2023, foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin \nto expire in 2028. It is more likely than not that the majority of the net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized; therefore, we \nhave recorded a valuation allowance against them. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations \nunder the tax laws of the different jurisdictions.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our Federal and California research and development credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were \napproximately $400 million and $5.8 billion, respectively. If not utilized, the Federal R&D credit will begin to expire in 2037 and the \nCalifornia R&D credit can be carried over indefinitely. We believe the majority of the federal tax credit and state tax credit is not likely \nto be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our investment tax credit carryforwards for state income tax purposes were approximately $931 million \nand will begin to expire in 2025. We use the flow-through method of accounting for investment tax credits. We believe this tax credit \nis not likely to be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to California deferred tax assets, certain federal net \noperating losses, certain state net operating losses and tax credits, net deferred tax assets relating to certain Other Bets, and certain \nforeign net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized. We continue to reassess the remaining valuation allowance \nquarterly, and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\n\n80\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020\n2021\n2022\nBeginning gross unrecognized tax benefits\n$\n3,377\n$\n3,837\n$\n5,158\nIncreases related to prior year tax positions\n372\n529\n253\nDecreases related to prior year tax positions\n(557)\n(263)\n(437)\nDecreases related to settlement with tax authorities\n(45)\n(329)\n(140)\nIncreases related to current year tax positions\n690\n1,384\n2,221\nEnding gross unrecognized tax benefits\n$\n3,837\n$\n5,158\n$\n7,055\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax \npositions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $3.8 billion, \n$5.2 billion, and $7.1 billion as of December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively, of which $2.6 billion, $3.7 billion, and $5.3 billion, \nif recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively. \nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we accrued $270 million and $346 million in interest and penalties in provision for income taxes, \nrespectively.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two major tax jurisdictions \nare the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax \nauthorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2018 tax returns. We have also received tax assessments in multiple \nforeign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend any and all such \nclaims as presented.\nThe tax years 2015 through 2021 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. \nThere are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision \nfor income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the \nexpected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the \noutcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not \nconsistent with management’s expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such \nresolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that our \nunrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S. tax positions could decrease by approximately $1.8 billion in \nthe next 12 months. Positions that may be resolved include various U.S. and non-U.S. matters.\n\n81\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nNote 15.\tInformation about Segments and Geographic Areas \nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n \nz Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and \nYouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and \nfees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\n \nz Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. \nGoogle Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and \ncollaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n \nz Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are \ngenerated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services. \nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and hardware, as \nwell as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and \nexpenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. The associated costs, \nincluding depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage or headcount.\nUnallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and legal, including certain \nfines and settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared R&D activities. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to \nrevenue are included in corporate costs. \nAs AI is critical to delivering our mission of bringing our breakthrough innovations into the real world, beginning in January 2023, we \nwill update our segment reporting relating to certain of Alphabet’s AI activities. DeepMind, previously reported within Other Bets, will \nbe reported as part of Alphabet’s corporate costs, reflecting its increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and \nOther Bets.

And, yes, you will see some big numbers shared \nin the pages of this report and in future earnings calls as \nwell, but 22-plus years in, Google is still not a conventional \ncompany (and we don’t intend to become one). \nAnd 2020 was anything but a conventional year. \nThat’s why over the past 12 months we’ve \nmeasured our success by the people we’ve helped in \nmoments that matter. Our success is in the researchers \nwho used our technology to fight the spread of the \ncoronavirus. It’s in job seekers like Rey Justo, who, after \nbeing laid off during the pandemic, earned a Google \nCareer Certificate online and was hired into a great new \ncareer. And our success is in all the small businesses who \nused Google products to continue serving customers \nand keeping employees on payroll ... in the students who \nkept learning virtually on Google Classroom ... and in the \ngrandparents who read bedtime stories to grandchildren \nfrom thousands of miles away over Google Meet. \nWe’ve always believed that we only succeed when \nothers do. And that success is only possible because \nof the incredible teams I have the privilege of leading \nacross Alphabet. Teams who, over the past year — at \nhome with kids on their laps and pets at their feet — \nnever stopped working to deliver on our mission and \nour core pillars of helpfulness, trust, execution, and \nsupporting our partners. Teams who continue to create \nsustainable financial value. Teams full of optimists who \nbelieve in technology’s ability to make things better for \npeople and communities everywhere.\nIn the pages of this report, you’ll read about some \nof the ways our products helped people, businesses, \nand communities adapt and recover. I hope they’ll inspire \nyou as much as they inspire me.\n\n5\nA look at 2020\nA look at 2020\nAcross Alphabet, we found ways to help people, \nbusinesses, and communities respond to a transforming \nworld — they weren’t just having to adapt, they were \nlearning to do everything in new ways. At Google, \nour response was guided by three focus areas: helpful \nproducts, trusted experiences, and supporting \nour partners.\n\nYear in Review\n6\nHelpful products \nfor an unpredictable time\nIn 2020, the world changed more quickly than ever, \nupending how we live and work. Since the outbreak \nof COVID-19, teams across Google have worked to \nprovide access to quality information and resources, \nand launched more than 200 new products, features, \nand initiatives. We wanted to meet people where they \nare, provide the help they need, and keep them safe \nat every step.\nTo support public health authorities around the \nworld in their fight against COVID-19, we partnered \nwith Apple to launch the Exposure Notifications System \n(ENS). Designed to protect users’ privacy while helping \npublic health authorities and governments manage \ntheir reopenings, the ENS enabled 50 countries, states, \nand regions to build apps based on the technology.\nMaking essential information easily accessible in \ndaily life was paramount — we expanded the Search and \nYouTube experience with knowledge panels featuring \nlocal guidance and information about COVID-19 \nsymptoms and prevention, and introduced the COVID \nlayer in Google Maps, a tool that shows information \nabout COVID-19 cases in an area to help users make \ninformed decisions about their travel.\nAs people searched for safe ways to stay connected \nand productive, we made Google Meet, our premium \nvideoconferencing product, free for everyone; anyone \nwith a Gmail address could enjoy many of the same \nfeatures available to our Google Cloud business and \neducation users.\nWe also pledged over $1 billion to assist our users, \ncustomers, and partners around the world, including \n$450 million in Ad Grants to worldwide government \nagencies like the World Health Organization (WHO). As \na result, we served over 2.6 billion PSAs from local public \nhealth agencies — seen by billions of people globally — \nto make sure authoritative information reached as many \npeople as possible. \nBeyond solving for immediate needs, we were also \nthinking about the future. Our 2019 quantum supremacy \nmilestone led us into a new era of quantum computing, \nwith the potential to take on challenges like designing \nmore efficient batteries or determining what molecules \nmight make effective medicines. But discovering practical \napplications is not something we can do alone. That’s \nwhy we launched qsim, a new open source quantum \nsimulator that will help researchers develop quantum \nalgorithms. By inviting researchers everywhere to join us \nin this effort, we hope to accelerate the breakthroughs \nquantum computing can make possible.\n\n7\nHelpful products\nNew knowledge panels in Search made it easy for people to find \nthe latest news and authoritative guidance any time they searched \nabout COVID-19 topics.

Consult your local \nmedical authority for advice. \nIn Maps, we added a new COVID layer that helps people see the \ndensity of cases in an area and how they’re trending. Source: JHU \nCSSE COVID-19 Data and other attributed sources.\nGoogle and Apple jointly created the Exposure Notifications System \nout of a shared sense of responsibility to help governments and our \nglobal community fight the pandemic through contact tracing.\nConnecting by video chat was crucial to bringing people together, \nso we made Google Meet, our premium videoconferencing product, \nfree for everyone.\n\nYear in Review\n8\nAs 1.5 billion learners were impacted by school closures, our tools \nlike Google Classroom were there to help.\nTo give teachers and families the tools and tips they needed to help \nkeep students learning, our Teach from Anywhere site provided \nessential distance learning resources. \n\n9\nHelpful products\nSince Google’s beyond-classical breakthrough \nin quantum computing in 2019, we’ve been \nbusy exploring what’s possible in the Noisy \nIntermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.\nWe launched a new Quantum AI website that \nbrings together research initiatives, educational \nmaterials, and open source tools, and invites \nresearchers everywhere to join us in exploring \nthe power of quantum.\n\nYear in Review\n10\nAs much of our lives moved online last year, the safety \nof our digital tools became even more critical. We \ncontinued to put privacy and security at the forefront \nof our products so that, every day, users are safer \nwith Google. Built-in protections across our products \nworked proactively to keep digital threats at bay. Gmail \nblocks more than 99.9% of spam and phishing attempts, \nand Google Play Protect scans over 100 billion apps \nfor malware and other issues each day. We also made \na number of updates: Location History, Web and App \nActivity, and YouTube History now delete automatically \nafter 18 months by default, and we enhanced Chrome \nwith Safety Check, an easy and intuitive way for users \nto confirm they’re browsing safely. Our re-launched \nSafety Center helped users explore how we protect their \nprivacy with one of the world’s most advanced security \ninfrastructures, and we made it even easier for them \nto manage their online security — in 2020, we saw more \ntraffic than ever, with Privacy Checkup receiving over \n1.1 million visitors per day and Security Checkup receiving \nmore than 3.9 million visitors per day.\nWe worked to keep misinformation off our platforms \nby raising authoritative content and supporting quality \njournalism. On YouTube, we expanded our COVID-19 \nmedical misinformation policy to remove content \nabout vaccines that contradicts consensus from health \nauthorities such as the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention (CDC) or the WHO. We also invested \n$6.5 million to support fact-checkers and global \nnonprofits combating misinformation, with an immediate \nfocus on COVID-19.\nLast year, Americans also turned to Google to \nfind information on voter registration, polling locations, \nelection results, and more. “How to register” and “how \nto vote” reminders across Search, Maps, and YouTube \nwere seen over 2 billion times. On Election Day, we \npartnered with the Associated Press to keep users \nup-to-date with real-time election results alongside \nrelevant searches.\nTrusted experiences \nfor a safer online world\nGoogle Play \napps are \nscanned\nminutes of \nvideo calls \nare protected\nphotos \nare \nencrypted\ninboxes \nare secured\n1.5B\n4B\n100B\n7.5B\nEvery day ...\n... to keep users safer with Google\n\n11\nTrusted experiences\nAcross our products, we work to provide safer experiences for \nusers of all ages. On Safer Internet Day 2020, we expanded the \nglobal availability of programs like Be Internet Awesome, which \nhelps kids learn how to make smart online choices at an early age. \nOn YouTube, we amplified authoritative \ninformation with information panels on \ntopics like voter registration and how to \nvote alongside relevant content. \nOur re-launched Safety Center provides a single destination \nfor privacy, security, and family safety across all Google products \nand services. \n\nYear in Review\n12\nWhen the world shifted to learning and working from \nhome, Google data centers kept us running, supported \nusers, and, crucially, supported our partners. Whether \nour partners are developers, advertisers, content \ncreators, or merchants, our performance is only made \npossible by their success. \nFor many of our customers, digital transformation \nin the cloud became an urgent business priority in 2020. \nLast year, Google hosted over a trillion minutes of video \nmeetings and over 2.9 billion users chose productivity \napps like Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, \nand Meet every single day. \nDevelopers were behind the apps that kept people \nentertained and connected while at home. To ensure \ndevelopers could access the latest information about \nour products, and could connect with us and each other, \nwe pivoted all our major conferences online, including \n11 weeks of developer content to support the launch \nof Android 11 Beta. This gave millions of developers easy \naccess to the information they need to build their \nbusinesses on Android and Google Play. We also released \nnew tools to help developers build more efficiently and \ngrow their business, as well as online training materials \nto expand their learning. \nThe retail sector has faced many challenges \nover the years, which have only intensified during the \npandemic. We made it free for retailers around the \nworld to list products on our Google Shopping tab and \nremoved commission fees for all sellers who participate \nin our Buy on Google checkout experience. To help \nretailers adapt to a new reality, we provided a real-time \nview into search trends relevant to their business in the \nGoogle Ads Insights page and made in-demand options \nlike curbside pickup and delivery central features in \nSearch and Maps.\nQuality journalism and a vibrant news industry \nremain critical. Our products give people choice \nand help them find high-quality journalism — from \ninternational stories to community reporting. In 2020, \nwe announced a $1 billion investment in partnerships \nwith news publishers and the future of news with the \nlaunch of Google News Showcase, a product and \nlicensing program that will give local, regional, and \nnational publications across the globe the opportunity \nto forge deeper relationships with their audiences \nthrough a richer news experience.\nSupporting our partners \n$1B\nIn 2020, we announced our \nlargest investment yet to \nsupport the future of news \nwith the launch of Google \nNews Showcase\n\n13\nSupporting our partners\nIn 2020, we optimized our data centers as we kept our employees, \nusers, and partners running. \nFree listings in Google Search results made \nretailers’ offers more accessible to the hundreds \nof millions of people who shop on Google \neach day.\nLeaders across the news industry, including Laura Saarikoski \n(Sanomat), Maria Exner (Zeit), and Jerzy Wójcik (Agora), convened \nat the Google News Initiative EMEA 2020 summit to discuss the \nfuture of news in Europe.\n\n14\n14\nYear in Review\nAfter New York issued its stay-at-home order, Celsious laundromat \nfounders Corinna and Theresa Williams had to adapt. They quickly \nshifted to dropoffs only and enabled online booking through Google. \n\n15\nOperating with responsibility \nOperating with responsibility \nOur aim to significantly improve the lives of as many \npeople as possible requires that we act thoughtfully \nand responsibly in all that we do. In 2020, that meant \namplifying our focus on economic recovery, equity and \ninclusion, and sustainability. \n\nYear in Review\n16\nEven early on, it was clear that small and midsize \nbusinesses especially would face devastating challenges \nthroughout the pandemic. One of the most pressing \nneeds was maintaining their access to capital, so we \nmade $180 million in low-interest loans and Google.org \ngrants available to small businesses in the United States \nthrough the Grow with Google Small Business Fund and \nour partnership with Opportunity Finance Network. \nWe also established a $200 million investment fund to \nsupport small businesses outside of the United States. \nTo help small businesses stay connected to their \ncustomers, we updated our free Business Profiles on \nSearch and Maps, making it possible for businesses \nto share if they’re offering things like dine-in, in-store \nshopping, no-contact delivery, or curbside pickup. \nToday, people can find this information in Search and \nMaps for more than 2 million restaurants and retailers in \nthe United States. We used Google’s Duplex technology \nto make calls to businesses and confirm information like \nupdated hours and temporary closures, enabling us to \nmake 3 million updates to business information globally, \nwhich have been seen by people over 20 billion times in \nSearch and Maps. One in three small business owners \nin the United States said that without digital tools, they \nwould have had to close all or part of their business,1 \nand 59% said that Google tools helped them survive \nthroughout the pandemic.2\nJust as technology has been a lifeline to help \nmany small businesses during the COVID-19 crisis, \nonline tools helped people get new skills and find good-\npaying jobs. We launched Grow with Google OnAir in \nMay, making free digital skills training available online \nto everyone in the United States and Canada for the \nfirst time. And because you shouldn’t need a college \ndiploma to have economic security, we announced new \nGoogle Career Certificates, online programs designed to \nprepare people for jobs in high-growth fields like project \nmanagement and data analytics. Google is hiring these \ncertificate graduates, and more than 130 employers \nhave joined our employer consortium, eager to hire \npeople who have earned these certificates.\nEconomic recovery \n$426B\n of economic activity\n2B+\n monthly direct connections\nIn 2020, Google Search, Google Play, \nYouTube, and Google advertising tools \nhelped provide $426 billion of economic \nactivity for more than 2 million American \nbusinesses, nonprofits, publishers, \ncreators, and developers.\nEvery month in 2020, Google helped \ndrive over 2 billion direct connections, \nincluding phone calls, requests for \ndirections, messages, bookings, and \nreviews for American businesses.\n1.  \n“ Digitally Empowered: How Digital Tools Power Small \nBusinesses Amid Covid-19,” Connected Commerce \nCouncil, May 2020.\n2.  \n“ Digitally Driven: U.S. Small Businesses Find a Digital Safety \nNet During COVID-19,” Connected Commerce Council, \nSeptember 2020.\n\n17\nEconnomic recovery\nIn collaboration with the German Retail Federation, we supported \nsmall stores like Bircan Er’s flower shop in Berlin by providing them \nwith free trainings, coachings, and digital tools to strengthen their \nlocal businesses.\nLocal organizations across the United States used the free Grow \nwith Google Applied Digital Skills curriculum to teach people \npractical skills to find jobs, thrive in the workplace, or grow their \nsmall businesses.\n\nYear in Review\n18\nThe racial injustices of 2020 forced the world to reckon \nwith the long-standing inequities that hold too many \npeople back from realizing their full potential. Tackling \nthese issues requires a systems-level approach, one \nthat starts with building for a sense of belonging in our \nworkplace and extends into the world. \nAs part of our concrete commitments to build \nsustainable equity for underrepresented communities — \nespecially Black+ Googlers and users — we’re improving \nour hiring and making Google a place where they \ncan stay and thrive. By 2025, we plan to improve \nrepresentation of underrepresented groups at senior \nlevels by 30% and will more than double the number \nof Black+ Googlers at all other levels. Our commitment \nto equity also extends to the thousands of suppliers \nwho help us run our business — we are committed to \nspending a minimum of $1 billion with diverse-owned \nsuppliers in the United States every year starting in 2021. \nBuilding products that are truly helpful for everyone \nmeans co-creating with underrepresented voices \nthroughout the product development process. From a \nnew feature in Search and Maps that helps people \nidentify and support Black-owned businesses to the new \nTalkBack braille keyboard for people who are blind or \nhave low vision, our products are designed to be helpful \nin the moments that matter to underrepresented groups. \nOur work here is never done; through research initiatives \nlike Project Euphonia, an AI-powered effort that is aiming \nto make speech recognition more accessible to people \nwith atypical speech, we’re committed to making sure \neveryone is included and understood. \nBeyond our walls, we focused on investing in \nprograms that create economic opportunity, improve \naccess to education, and support racial justice \norganizations. In 2020, we announced a $175 million \neconomic opportunity package to support Black \nbusiness owners, founders, job seekers, and developers, \nand committed $3 million to close racial equity gaps in \nCS education and increase Black representation in STEM. \nBuilding on $32 million in donations toward criminal \njustice reform over the past five years, Google.org also \ncommitted an additional $12 million in grants to advance \nracial justice and provided pro bono technical support, \nembedding Google employees at the Center for Policing \nEquity and Morehouse School of Medicine. \nAs we look to the future, we are committed to \ncontinuing to listen, learn, and take action to accelerate \nour progress toward a workplace and world where \neveryone can belong. \nEquity and inclusion to \ndrive meaningful change\nBy 2025, we will improve \nrepresentation of \nunderrepresented groups \nat senior levels by\n 30%\nand we will increase the \nnumber of Black+ Googlers \nat all other levels by at least\n 2X\n\n19\nEquity and inclusion\nWe are working to improve leadership representation of \nunderrepresented groups in order to build a more helpful Google \nfor everyone.\nProject Euphonia is a Google AI research effort aimed at helping to \nmake speech recognition more accessible for people with atypical \nspeech, like Steve Saling, an ALS technologist.\n\nYear in Review\n20\nThe science is clear: The world must act now if we’re \ngoing to avert the worst consequences of climate \nchange. We are committed to doing our part. Google was \nthe first major company to become carbon neutral, in \n2007, and the first major company to match our energy \nuse with 100% renewable energy, in 2017. In 2020, \nwe neutralized our legacy carbon footprint since our \nfounding, making Google the first major company to be \ncarbon neutral for its entire operating history. \nWe are proud to operate the cleanest cloud in \nthe industry — Google Cloud is the only major cloud \nprovider to purchase enough renewable energy to cover \nour entire operations, and Google is the largest annual \ncorporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world. \nBut we plan to go even further — by 2030, we aim to \nbecome the first major company to operate on carbon-\nfree energy 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a \nyear. This means every email sent through Gmail, every \nquestion asked to Google Search, and every YouTube \nvideo watched will be powered by data centers that are \nsupplied by clean energy every hour of every day. \nIn 2020, we issued $5.75 billion in sustainability \nbonds, the largest sustainability or green bond issuance \nby any company in history. The proceeds from these \nsustainability bonds will fund ongoing and new projects \nthat are environmentally or socially responsible and \nenable investors to join us in tackling critical issues.\nBeyond our operational commitments, we’re \nthinking about how we can help everyone reduce their \nenvironmental impact. Cities account for 70% of the \nworld’s carbon emissions. That’s why we created the \nEnvironmental Insights Explorer, a tool that helps cities \ntrack and reduce their carbon emissions and maximize \ntheir renewable energy use. We’re committed to helping \nover 500 cities and local governments reduce an \naggregate of 1 gigaton of carbon emissions annually \nby 2030. \nWe know that people are increasingly looking \nfor ways to minimize their environmental impact in \ntheir daily lives, including finding less carbon-intensive \nways to travel. By 2022, we’ll find new ways that our \ncore products can help 1 billion people make more \nsustainable choices.\nWe’re optimistic that by harnessing new \ntechnologies and empowering others, this can be the \nmost decisive decade for climate action yet. We’re \nproud to do our part and to help move the world closer \nto a carbon-free future for all.\nSustainability to \nsafeguard our planet\n1B\nBy 2022, we will offer \n1 billion people new ways \nto live more sustainably \nvia our core products. \nWe’ve been carbon \nneutral since\n2007\n\n21\nSustainability\nWe’re reducing the environmental impact of our operations and \nworking to empower people everywhere to live more sustainably.\nOne of our goals is to increase the sustainability and circularity of \nour consumer hardware products, operations, and communities — \none half-liter plastic water bottle can make enough textiles for two \nNest Mini speakers.\n\nYear in Review\n22\nOther bets\nWe continue to make ambitious bets on new technology \nacross Alphabet with the goal of using technology to \ntake on some of the greatest challenges we face today.\n\n23\nOther bets\nDeepMind\nIn 2020, DeepMind’s AI system, AlphaFold, was \nindependently recognised as a solution to the “protein \nfolding problem” — a 50-year-old grand challenge in \nbiology — creating the potential to accelerate progress \nin biological research.\nVerily\nVerily’s Baseline COVID-19 Testing Program expanded \naccess to essential, free screening and testing across \nthe United States, and its free COVID-19 Pathfinder \ndigital tool automated frontline support for health \nsystems and hospitals. Verily’s Healthy at Work program \nis supporting safe transitions back to work and school \nby combining testing, symptom tracking, data analytics, \nand the latest guidance from the CDC and other public \nhealth authorities.\nWaymo\nLast year, Waymo reached a major milestone with the \nlaunch of its public, commercial, fully autonomous \nride-hailing service in Phoenix, Arizona. By bringing the \n“World’s Most Experienced Driver” to the public, Waymo \ntook a significant step toward making it safe and easy for \npeople and things to get where they’re going. \n\nYear in Review\n24\nLooking ahead\nThe past year brought humanity’s capacity for resilience \nand adaptability into greater focus. We are inspired \nby that spirit as we continue to harness deep computer \nscience to propel new ideas and people forward.\n\n25\nLooking ahead\nThrough our India Digitization Fund, we will invest approximately \n$10 billion in India over the next five to seven years through equity \ninvestments, partnerships, and operational, infrastructure, and \necosystem investments. \nChromebook, the most used device for K-12 education globally \nin 2020, is launching its second decade of expanding education \nopportunities for students and teachers in 2021.\nAs we explore what the future of work and \nreturn to office can look like, we are bringing \njobs to and investing in diverse communities \nlike Atlanta, which will help bring us closer \nto realizing our racial equity commitments. \nRendering credit: RJTR\n\nUNITED STATES\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\nWashington, D.C. 20549\nFORM 10-K\n ANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020\nOR\n TRANSITION REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nFor the transition period from __________ to __________.\n(State or other jurisdiction of \nincorporation or organization)\n(Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter)\n(Address of principal executive offices, including zip code)\n(Registrant’s telephone number, including area code)\nCommission \nfile number:\n(I.R.S.

We do not intend to \nbecome one.” That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring us to tackle big problems, and \ninvest in moonshots like artificial intelligence (“AI”) research and quantum computing. We continue this work under the leadership \nof Sundar Pichai, who has served as CEO of Google since 2015 and as CEO of Alphabet since 2019. \nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google — which we report as two segments: Google Services and \nGoogle Cloud. We report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Our Other Bets include earlier stage technologies that \nare further afield from our core Google business. We take a long term view and manage the portfolio of Other Bets with the discipline \nand rigor needed to deliver long-term returns. Our Alphabet structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong \nleaders and independence. \nAccess and technology for everyone\nThe Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers, capable of propelling new ideas and people forward. Our mission to \norganize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was when we were founded \nin 1998. Since then, we’ve evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that helps you get things done. \nWe’re focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools they need to increase \ntheir knowledge, health, happiness and success.\nAcross Alphabet, we’re focused on continually innovating in areas where technology can have an impact on people’s lives. Every year, \nthere are trillions of searches on Google, and we continue to invest deeply in AI and other technologies to ensure the most helpful \nSearch experience possible. People come to YouTube for entertainment, information and opportunities to learn something new. And \nGoogle Assistant offers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices, providing intelligent help throughout \nyour day, no matter where you are.\nSince the pandemic began, our teams have built new features to help users go about their daily lives, and to support businesses \nworking to serve their customers during an uncertain time. In conjunction with Apple, we launched Exposure Notification apps that \nare being used by local governments globally. Our COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports are used by public health agencies and \nresearchers around the globe, and we’ve committed hundreds of millions of dollars to help small businesses through a combination \nof small business loans, grants and ad credits. Importantly, we’ve made authoritative content a key focus area across both Google \nSearch and YouTube to help users search for trusted public health information. \nOur Other Bets are also pursuing initiatives with similar goals. For instance, as a part of our efforts in the Metro Phoenix area, Waymo \nis working toward our goal of making transportation safer and easier for everyone while Verily is developing tools and platforms to \nimprove health outcomes.\nMoonshots\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads \nto irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were \ncrazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, but those efforts have matured into major platforms \nfor digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. We continue to look toward the future and continue to invest for \nthe long-term. As we said in the original founders’ letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in \nbecause they are the key to our long-term success.\nThe power of machine learning\nAcross the company, machine learning and AI are increasingly driving many of our latest innovations. Our investments in machine \nlearning over the past decade have enabled us to build products that are smarter and more helpful. For example, a huge breakthrough \nin natural language understanding, called BERT, now improves results for almost every English language search query.\n\n2\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1  BUSINESS\nDeepMind made a significant AI-powered breakthrough, solving a 50-year-old protein folding challenge, which will help us better \nunderstand one of life’s fundamental building blocks, and will enable researchers to tackle new and difficult problems, from fighting \ndiseases to environmental sustainability.\nGoogle\nFor reporting purposes, Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\nGoogle Services\nSERVING OUR USERS\nWe have always been a company committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people. Our \nproduct innovations have made our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Google Services’ \ncore products and platforms include Android, Chrome, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and \nYouTube, each with broad and growing adoption by users around the world.\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than two decades ago. Rather than the ten \nblue links in our early search results, users can now get direct answers to their questions using their computer, mobile device, or \ntheir own voice, making it quicker, easier and more natural to find what you’re looking for. \nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and creation of digital \ncontent, on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. With the migration to mobile, people are consuming more \ndigital content by watching more videos, playing more games, listening to more music, reading more books, and using more apps \nthan ever before. Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to find \ngreat digital content.\nFueling all of these great digital experiences are powerful platforms and hardware. That’s why we continue to invest in platforms like \nour Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, Chrome operating system, as well as growing our family of great hardware \ndevices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful, make your life easier, and get better over time, by combining the best \nof our AI, software, and hardware. This is reflected in our latest generation of hardware products like Pixel 4a, Pixel 4a 5G and \nPixel 5 phones, Chromecast with Google TV and the Google Nest Hub smart display. Creating beautiful products that people rely on \nevery day is a journey that we are investing in for the long run.\nKey to building helpful products for users is our commitment to privacy, security and user choice. As the Internet evolves, we continue \nto invest in keeping data safe, including enhanced malware features in Chrome and improvements to auto-delete controls that will \nautomatically delete web and app searches after 18 months. \nHOW WE MAKE MONEY\nOur advertising products deliver relevant ads at just the right time, to give people useful commercial information, regardless of the \ndevice they’re using. We also provide advertisers with tools that help them better attribute and measure their advertising campaigns. \nOur advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses, and we offer a wide range of products across devices \nand formats. Google Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance advertising and brand advertising.\nz Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on, leading to direct engagement with advertisers. \nMost of our performance advertisers pay us when a user engages in their ads. Performance advertising lets our advertisers \nconnect with users while driving measurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads \nthat appear on Google Search & other properties, YouTube and the properties of Google Network Members. In addition, Google \nNetwork Members use our platforms to display relevant ads on their properties, generating revenues when site visitors view or \nclick on the ads. We continue to invest in our advertising programs and make significant upgrades.\nz Brand advertising helps enhance users’ awareness of and affinity with advertisers’ products and services, through videos, text, \nimages, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types \nof ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns.\nWe have built a world-class ad technology platform for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital marketing \nbusinesses. We aim to ensure great user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships \nwith brands and agencies. We also seek to improve the measurability of advertising so advertisers know when their campaigns are \neffective.\n\n3\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1  BUSINESS\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating \nthe best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, ranging from filtering out invalid traffic, removing billions \nof bad ads from our systems every year to closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them \nwhen necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\nWe continue to look to the future and are making long-term investments that will grow revenues beyond advertising, including Google \nPlay, hardware, and YouTube. We are also investing in research efforts in AI and quantum computing to foster innovation across our \nbusinesses and create new opportunities.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle was a company built in the cloud. We continue to invest in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI. We \nsee significant opportunity in helping businesses utilize these strengths with features like data migration, modern development \nenvironments and machine learning tools to provide enterprise-ready cloud services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google \nWorkspace (formerly known as G Suite). Google Cloud Platform enables developers to build, test, and deploy applications on its \nhighly scalable and reliable infrastructure. Our Google Workspace collaboration tools — which include apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, \nCalendar, Meet and more — are designed with real-time collaboration and machine intelligence to help people work smarter. Because \nmore and more of today’s great digital experiences are being built in the cloud, our Google Cloud products help businesses of all \nsizes take advantage of the latest technology advances to operate more efficiently.\nGoogle Cloud generates revenues primarily from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services and Google Workspace collaboration \ntools.\nOther Bets\nThroughout Alphabet, we are also using technology to try and solve big problems across many industries. Alphabet’s investment in \nour portfolio of Other Bets include emerging businesses at various stages of development, ranging from those in the research and \ndevelopment phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving, \nsuccessful businesses in the medium to long term. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, \nsome of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues are primarily generated \nfrom internet and TV services, as well as licensing and R&D services.\nOther Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside \ninvestors. We are investing in our portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable competition in every \naspect of our business, particularly from companies that seek to connect people with online information and provide them with \nrelevant advertising. We face competition from:\nz General purpose search engines and information services, such as Baidu, Microsoft’s Bing, Naver, Seznam, Verizon’s Yahoo, and \nYandex.\nz Vertical search engines and e-commerce websites, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking’s Kayak (travel queries), \nMicrosoft’s LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and \napps rather than go through Google.\nz Social networks, such as Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service \nreferrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\nz Other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television. Our advertisers typically advertise in \nmultiple media, both online and offline.\nz Other online advertising platforms and networks, including Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Facebook, that compete for advertisers \nthat use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.\nz Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&T, Disney, Facebook, Hulu, Netflix and TikTok.\n\n4\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1  BUSINESS\nIn businesses that are further afield from our advertising business, we compete with companies that have longer operating histories \nand more established relationships with customers and users. We face competition from:\nz Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\nz Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed \nproprietary platforms.\nz Providers of enterprise cloud services, including Alibaba, Amazon, and Microsoft.\nz Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to deliver and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace \nacross our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\nz Users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, \nas well as the general usefulness, security and availability of our products and services.\nz Advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements \nin an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels.\nz Content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from \nadvertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\nOngoing Commitment to Sustainability\nAt Google, we build technology that helps people do more for the planet. We strive to build sustainability into everything we do, \nincluding designing and operating efficient data centers, advancing carbon-free energy, creating sustainable workplaces, building \nbetter devices and services, empowering users with technology, and enabling a responsible supply chain.\nGoogle has been carbon neutral since 2007, and in 2019, for the third consecutive year, we matched 100% of our electricity consumption \nwith renewable energy purchases. We are the largest annual corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world, based on renewable \nelectricity purchased in megawatt-hour (MWh). In 2020, we neutralized our entire legacy carbon footprint since our founding (covering \nall our operational emissions before we became carbon neutral in 2007), making Google the first major company to achieve carbon \nneutrality for its entire operating history. In our third decade of climate action, we’ve set our most ambitious goal yet: to run our \nbusiness on carbon-free energy everywhere, at all times, by 2030.\nWe’re also investing in technologies to help our partners and people all over the world make sustainable choices. For example, we \nintend to enable 5 GW of new carbon-free energy across our key manufacturing regions by 2030 through investment. We anticipate \nthis will spur more than $5 billion in clean energy investments, avoid the amount of emissions equal to taking more than 1 million cars \noff the road each year, and create more than 8,000 clean energy jobs. With the Environmental Insights Explorer, we’re also working to \nhelp more than 500 cities and local governments globally reduce a total of 1 gigaton of carbon emissions annually by 2030 — that’s \nthe equivalent of the annual carbon emissions of a country the size of Japan.\nGoogle’s products are already helping people make more sustainable choices in their daily lives, whether it’s using Google Maps \nto find bike-shares and electric vehicle charging stations, or in many European countries, using Google Flights to sort the least \ncarbon-intensive option flights. There are more tools and information we can provide, and our goal is to find new ways that our \nproducts can help 1 billion people make more sustainable choices by 2022.\nClimate change is one of the most significant global challenges of our time. In 2017, we developed a climate resilience strategy, \nwhich included conducting a climate scenario analysis. We’ve earned a spot on the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) \nClimate Change A List for seven consecutive years. We believe our CDP climate change response reflects the recommendations of \nthe Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\nIn 2020, we issued $5.75 billion in sustainability bonds, the largest sustainability or green bond issuance by any company in history. \nThe net proceeds from the issuance are used to fund environmentally and socially responsible projects in the following eight areas: \nenergy efficiency, clean energy, green buildings, clean transportation, circular economy and design, affordable housing, commitment \nto racial equity, and support for small businesses and COVID-19 crisis response.\nMore information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports, including Google’s environmental \nreport. The content of our sustainability reports are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any \nother report or document we file with the SEC.\n\n5\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1  BUSINESS\nCulture and Workforce\nWe’re a company of curious, talented and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and encourage the iteration \nof ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society. \nOur people are critical for our continued success. We work hard to provide an environment where Googlers can have fulfilling careers, \nand be happy, healthy and productive. We offer industry-leading benefits and programs to take care of the diverse needs of our \nemployees and their families, including access to excellent healthcare choices, opportunities for career growth and development, \nand resources to support their financial health. Our competitive compensation programs help us to attract and retain top candidates, \nand we will continue to invest in recruiting talented people to technical and non-technical roles and rewarding them well.\nAlphabet is committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and we’re committed to growing a workforce \nthat’s representative of the users we serve. More information on Google’s approach to diversity can be found in our annual diversity \nreports, available publicly at diversity.google. The content of our diversity reports is not incorporated by reference into this Annual \nReport on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.\nWe have work councils and statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries and we are committed to supporting \nprotected labor rights, maintaining an open culture and listening to all Googlers. Supporting healthy and open dialogue is central \nto how we work, and we communicate information about the company through multiple internal channels to our employees. As of \nDecember 31, 2020, Alphabet had 135,301 employees. \nWhen necessary, we contract with businesses around the world to provide specialized services where we don’t have appropriate \nin-house expertise or resources, often in fields that require specialized training like cafe operations, customer support, content \nmoderation and physical security. We also contract with temporary staffing agencies when we need to cover short-term leaves, \nwhen we have spikes in business needs, or when we need to quickly incubate special projects. We choose our partners and staffing \nagencies carefully, and review their compliance with Google’s Supplier Code of Conduct. We continually make improvements to \npromote a respectful and positive working environment for everyone — employees, vendors and temporary staff alike.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. Like \nother companies in the technology industry, we face heightened scrutiny from both U.S. and foreign governments with respect to our \ncompliance with laws and regulations. Our compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could, individually or in \nthe aggregate, increase our cost of doing business, impact our competitive position relative to our peers, and/or otherwise have an \nadverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. For additional information about government \nregulation applicable to our business, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A, Trends in Our Business in Part II, Item 7, and Legal Matters \nin Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology \nand our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain \nnames and copyrights. We have also filed patent applications in the U.S. and foreign countries covering certain of our technology, \nand acquired patent assets to supplement our portfolio. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, \ncertain of our rights to other parties.\nSeasonality\nOur business is affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends such \nas traditional retail seasonality (including developments and volatility arising from COVID-19).\nAvailable Information\nOur website is located at www.abc.xyz, and our investor relations website is located at www.abc.xyz/investor. Our Annual Reports \non Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and our Proxy Statements, and any amendments to \nthese reports, are available through our investor relations website, free of charge, after we file them with the SEC.

RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described below, \nwhich could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nRisks Specific to our Company\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising, and reduced spending by advertisers, a loss of partners, or \nnew and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize ads could harm our business. \nWe generated over 80% of total revenues from the display of ads online in 2020. Many of our advertisers, companies that distribute \nour products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at any time. These partners \nmay not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new \nsales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising \npolicies and data privacy practices, as well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices may affect the \nadvertising that we are able to provide, which could harm our business. In addition, technologies have been developed that make \ncustomized ads more difficult or that block the display of ads altogether and some providers of online services have integrated \ntechnologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior \nvalue or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. \nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including COVID-19 and its effects on the global economy (as discussed in greater detail in \nour COVID-19 risk factor under ‘General Risks’ below), have impacted the demand for advertising and resulted in fluctuations in the \namounts our advertisers spend on advertising, and could have an adverse impact on such demand and spend, which could harm \nour financial condition and operating results.\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we \nmay not remain competitive, which could harm our business and operating results.\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing technologies, shifting user \nneeds, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately anticipate technology \ndevelopments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses \nevolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services. We must continue to invest \nsignificant resources in research and development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and new and \nexisting products and services.\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from \nlarge and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer operating histories and well established \nrelationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position, \nincluding by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in research and development and in talent, aggressively initiating \nintellectual property claims (whether or not meritorious), and continuing to compete aggressively for users, advertisers, customers, \nand content providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively \ninterpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our competitors may also be \nable to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before us.\nOur operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the needs of our users, advertisers, publishers, \ncustomers, and content providers. As technologies continue to develop, our competitors may be able to offer experiences that are, or \nthat are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant \nresources in order to remain competitive. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or \nin attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers, our operating results could be harmed.\n\n7\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt our \ncurrent operations and harm our financial condition and operating results. \nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The investments that \nwe are making across Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products \nand services that are useful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our investments in Google Services, \nGoogle Cloud and Other Bets span a wide range of industries beyond online advertising. Such investments ultimately may not be \ncommercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in pursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated \nliabilities. These endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of management resources and, with \nrespect to Other Bets, the use of alternative investment, governance, or compensation structures that may fail to adequately align \nincentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones and home devices, which is a highly \ncompetitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption of technological advancements by \ncompetitors, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance \ncharacteristics, and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be \nable to provide hardware that competes effectively.\nWithin Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, including Google \nCloud Platform and Google Workspace. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing \nservices and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our salesforce. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing \nand deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models are competitive and evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale \nand profitability to achieve our business objectives.\nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among others. These \ninvestment areas face intense competition from large experienced and well-funded competitors and our offerings may not be able \nto compete effectively or to operate at sufficient levels of profitability.\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use artificial intelligence and machine learning, raise ethical, \ntechnological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and \nservices. Because all of these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will \nbe successful and will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future. \nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition and the continued \nexpansion of our business into a variety of new fields. Changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product and policy changes, \nproduct mix, and property mix and an increasing competition for advertising may also affect our advertising revenue growth rate. \nWe may also experience a decline in our revenue growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, if there is a decrease in the \nrate of adoption of our products, services, and technologies, or due to deceleration or decline in demand for devices used to access \nour services, among other factors. In addition, COVID-19 and its effects on the global economy has impacted and may continue to \nadversely impact our revenue growth rate (as discussed in greater detail in our COVID-19 risk factor under ‘General Risks’ below).\nIn addition to a decline in our revenue growth rate, we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting \nfrom a variety of factors, such as the continued expansion of our business into new fields, including products and services such as \nhardware, Google Cloud, and subscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins \nlower than those we generate from advertising. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing \nregulations, increasing competition and increased costs for many aspects of our business, including within advertising where changes \nsuch as device mix, property mix, and partner agreements can affect margin. The margin we earn on revenues generated from our \nGoogle Network Members could also decrease in the future if we pay a larger percentage of advertising fees to them. We may also \npay increased TAC to our distribution partners as well as increased content acquisition costs to content providers. We may also face \nan increase in infrastructure costs, supporting businesses such as Search, Google Cloud, and YouTube. Many of our expenses are \nless variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenues. \nDue to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may \nnot be indicative of our future performance.\n\n8\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services \nand brands as well as affect our ability to compete. \nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events \noutside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services, and technologies. For \nexample, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are \ndistributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be \nsufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect \nsome of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later \nturn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will \nbe insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitive \ninformation could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets. \nWe also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word “Google” could become so commonly \nused that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” Some courts have ruled that “Google” is a protectable trademark, but it is \npossible that other courts, particularly those outside of the United States, may reach a different determination. If this happens, we \ncould lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, \nthus diminishing our brand.\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting \nour intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could \nmake it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.\nOur business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our \nbase of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. \nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google \nServices, Google Cloud and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products that better \nserve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. Our brands may be negatively affected \nby a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and \nsecurity issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to appropriately respond to \nthe sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable practices by advertisers, \nor to otherwise adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands.\nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance equity in our brands may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nOur success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality, innovative products \nand services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of settings.\nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could harm our financial condition, \noperating results, and prospects. \nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability to supply both our \nproducts and our internet-based services.\nWe rely on other companies to manufacture many of our finished products, to design certain of our components and parts, and \nto participate in the distribution of our products and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to \nengage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their \nobligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms \nof our arrangements with them.\nWe have experienced and/or may experience supply shortages and price increases driven by raw material, component or part \navailability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, natural disasters or \npandemics (including COVID-19), the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and increased \nstorm severity), and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers. We have experienced and/or may in \nthe future, experience shortages or other supply chain disruptions that could negatively affect our operations. In addition, some of \nthe components we use in our technical infrastructure and products are available from only one or limited sources, and we may not \nbe able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. In addition, a significant supply \ninterruption could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay product availability.\n\n9\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nWe may enter into long term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and conditions. We may be liable \nfor materials and products that are not consumed due to market acceptance, technological change, obsolescences, quality, product \nrecalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of our hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum \npurchase requirements, if the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased \nmaterials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture \nand negatively affect our financial results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms \nbased on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply.\nOur products and services may have quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, or operations. Sometimes, these issues may \nbe caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not \nmeet expectations or our products or services are defective, it could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies, such as the Google \nSupplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance and intellectual \nproperty licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. Violations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply \nchain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license \nrights to intellectual property, could affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims.\nInterruption, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications systems could hurt our \nability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating \nresults. In addition, complications with the design or implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system \ncould harm our business and operations.\nThe availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation of our \ninformation technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage, interference, or interruption from \nmodifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, natural disasters or pandemics (including COVID-19), the effects of climate change \n(such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and increased storm severity), power loss, telecommunications failures, computer \nviruses, ransomware attacks, computer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. \nSome of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are \nalso subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions resulting from \nproblems experienced by facility operators. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot \naccount for all eventualities.\nThe occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic (including COVID-19), closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems at, \nor impacting, our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly \ntechnical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities, which could result in interruptions in or failure of our services \nor systems.\nIn addition, we rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results. \nWe are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new ERP system, which will replace much of our existing core financial \nsystems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve \ndata management, and provide timely information to our management team. We may not be able to successfully implement the \nERP system without experiencing delays, increased costs, and other difficulties. Failure to successfully design and implement the new \nERP system as planned could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Additionally, if we do not effectively \nimplement the ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control \nover financial reporting could be negatively affected.\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, our financial condition, and \noperating results.\nOur international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow internationally. International \nrevenues accounted for approximately 53% of our consolidated revenues in 2020. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this \nsection, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following: \nz Restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating \ncash earned in countries outside the U.S.\nz Import and export requirements, tariffs and other market access barriers that may prevent or impede us from offering products or \nproviding services to a particular market, or that could limit our ability to source assemblies and finished products from a particular \nmarket, and may increase our operating costs.\nz Longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud.\n\n10\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nz Evolving foreign events, including the effect of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, may adversely affect our \nrevenues and could subject us to new regulatory costs and challenges (including the transfer of personal data between the EU and \nthe United Kingdom and new customer requirements), in addition to other adverse effects that we are unable to effectively anticipate.\nz Anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain payments to government \nofficials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties.\nz Uncertainty regarding liability for services and content, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent.\nz Different employee/employer relationships, existence of works councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, \nlanguage, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions.\nBecause we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure \nto fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant \nfluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings, \nparticularly in light of market volatilities due to COVID-19. Hedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional \nrisks that could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to our Industry\nPeople access the Internet through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the advancement of \ntechnology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our products and services \ndeveloped for these interfaces, our business could be harmed. \nPeople access the Internet through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, mobile phones, smartphones, laptops and \ntablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables, automobiles, and television-streaming devices. Our products and \nservices may be less popular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its \ndevices, and our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited functionality for our users or our \nadvertisers on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices. In addition, \nsearch queries are increasingly being undertaken via voice-activated speakers, apps, social media or other platforms, which could \nharm our business. It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing \ncompetitive new products and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and supporting products \nand services across multiple platforms and devices. Failing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers, \nsuppliers, distributors, developers, and users, or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and \nplatforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities.\nData privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could damage our reputation, cause us to \nincur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. Software \nbugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks on our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data \nand interference with our users and customers’ ability to use our products and services, harming our business operations and \nreputation. \nConcerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other data-privacy-\nrelated matters, even if unfounded, could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices \nmay change over time as expectations regarding privacy and data change.\nOur products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive information, and bugs, theft, \nmisuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information, \nimproper use and disclosure of such information, litigation, and other potential liability. Systems and control failures, security breaches, \nfailure to comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in government and legal exposure, \nseriously harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business, and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers. \nWe expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that shield against bugs, theft, misuse, or \nsecurity vulnerabilities or breaches.\nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. We may experience \nfuture security issues, whether due to employee error or malfeasance or system errors or vulnerabilities in our or other parties’ \nsystems, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure. Government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and \nadverse press coverage could harm our business. We may be unable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement \nadequate preventative measures. Attacks and security issues could also compromise trade secrets and other sensitive information, \nharming our business.\n\n11\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nWhile we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including dedicated worldwide \nincident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or pandemic (including COVID-19), may \nnot be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not respond quickly enough, or may fail to sufficiently \nremediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal, reputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, \nfinancial condition, and operating results.\nOur ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of our platforms and misuse \nof user data. \nIn addition to our efforts to mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety, security, and content review \nefforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties, including investigations and review \nof platform applications that could access the information of users of our services. As a result of these efforts, we could discover \nincidents of unnecessary access to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. We may not discover all such \nincidents or activity, whether as a result of our data limitations, including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale \nof activity on our platform, or other factors, including factors outside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic (including \nCOVID-19), and we may be notified of such incidents or activity via third parties. Such incidents and activities may include the use \nof user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user \naccounts, election interference, improper ad purchases, activities that threaten people’s safety on- or offline, or instances of spamming, \nscraping, or spreading disinformation. We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate \nany such incidents. Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and \nbrands, require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adversely affect our business and \nfinancial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result in \nmonetary penalties and damages, divert management’s time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\nProblematic content on our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content farms, and other \nviolations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could damage our reputation and deter our current \nand potential users from using our products and services. \nWe, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms, including sophisticated attempts by \nbad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate revenues, or to otherwise generate traffic that \ndoes not represent genuine user interest or intent. While we invest significantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant results \nand to detect and prevent low-quality content and invalid traffic, we may be unable to adequately detect and prevent such abuses or \npromote high-quality content, particularly during times of a natural disaster or pandemic (including COVID-19).\nMany websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than \nour search engine’s assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts (known as “web spam”) may affect the \nquality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading or undesirable content.\nAlthough English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we \nexpect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their rankings. We continuously combat web spam in our \nsearch results, including through indexing technology that makes it harder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. We \nalso continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam from abusing our platforms.\nWe also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including content farms, which are websites that \ngenerate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic \nchanges focused on detecting and preventing abuse from low-quality websites.\nWe also face other challenges on our platforms, including violations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted \nelection interference, activities that threaten the safety and/or well-being of our users on- or offline, and the spreading of disinformation, \namong other challenges.\nIf we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality content, it could hurt our \nreputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our financial condition or operating results. It \nmay also subject us to litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management’s \ntime and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may \nbe able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional \nexpenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant \nbandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband \nand internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, \n\n12\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nand government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take measures that \ncould degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their \ninfrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by \nproviding our competitors preferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination \nby internet access providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the United States and elsewhere regarding such protections. \nFor example, in 2018 the United States Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could permit \ninternet access providers to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services. In addition, in \nsome jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or blockages. COVID-19 has \nalso resulted in quarantines, shelter in place orders, and work from home directives, all of which have increased demands for internet \naccess and may create access challenges. These could result in a loss of existing users, customers and advertisers, goodwill, and \nincreased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new users, customers and advertisers, thereby harming our business.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nWe face increased regulatory scrutiny as well as changes in regulatory conditions, laws and policies governing a wide range of \ntopics that may negatively affect our business. \nWe and other companies in the technology industry face increased regulatory scrutiny, enforcement action, and other proceedings. \nFor instance, the U.S. Department of Justice, joined by a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint against \nGoogle on October 20, 2020, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. Separately, \non December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against Google in the United States District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating \nto its advertising technology. Various other regulatory agencies in the United States and around the world, including competition \nenforcers, consumer protection agencies, data protection authorities, grand juries, inter-agency consultative groups, and a range of \nother governmental bodies have and continue to review our products and services and their compliance with laws and regulations \naround the world. We continue to cooperate with these investigations. Various laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, \nand regulatory actions have in the past and may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing auditing \nand monitoring obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral \nlitigation, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nChanges in international and local social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide \nrange of topics may increase our cost of doing business, limit our ability to pursue certain business models, offer products or services \nin certain jurisdictions, or cause us to change our business practices. We have in the past had to alter or withdraw certain products \nand services as a result of laws or regulations that made them unfeasible, and new laws or regulations, such as the News Media \nBargaining Code drafted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission currently tabled in parliament, could result in our \nhaving to alter or withdraw products and services in the future. These additional costs of doing business, new limitations or changes \nto our business model or practices could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nA variety of new and existing laws and/or interpretations could harm our business. \nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. New laws and regulations \n(or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner inconsistent with our practices) may make our \nproducts and services less useful, limit our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and services, require \nus to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices. These laws and \nregulations are evolving and involve matters central to our business, including, among others:\nz New competition laws and related regulations around the world, that can limit certain business practices, and in some cases, \ncreate the risk of significant penalties.\nz Privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 that came into effect in January of 2020 and the California \nPrivacy Rights Act which will go into effect in 2023, both of which give new data privacy rights to California residents, and SB-327 \nin California, which regulates the security of data in connection with internet connected devices.\nz Data protection laws passed by many states within the U.S. and by certain countries regarding notification to data subjects and/\nor regulators when there is a security breach of personal data.\nz New laws further restricting the collection, processing and/or sharing of advertising-related data.\nz Copyright or similar laws around the world, including the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (EUCD) of \nApril 17, 2019, which EU Member States must implement by June 7, 2021; and the News Media Bargaining Code drafted by the \nAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission. These and similar laws that have been adopted or proposed introduce new \nconstraining licensing regimes that could affect our ability to operate. The EUCD and similar laws could increase the liability of some \ncontent-sharing services with respect to content uploaded by their users. Some of these laws, as well as follow-on administrative \n\n13\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nor judicial actions, have also created or may create a new property right in news publications that limits the ability of some online \nservices to interact with or present such content. They may also impose compensation negotiations with news agencies and \npublishers for the use of such content, which may result in payment obligations that significantly exceed the value that such \ncontent provides to Google and its users.\nz Data localization laws, which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored and/or \nprocessed within that country.\nz Various U.S. and international laws that govern the distribution of certain materials to children and regulate the ability of online \nservices to collect information from minors.\nz Various laws with regard to content removal and disclosure obligations, such as the Network Enforcement Act in Germany, which \nmay affect our businesses and operations and may subject us to significant fines if such laws are interpreted and applied in a \nmanner inconsistent with our practices or when we may not proactively discover such content due to the scale of third-party \ncontent and the limitations of existing technologies. Other countries, including Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom, have \nimplemented or are considering similar legislation imposing penalties for failure to remove certain types of content.\nz Various legislative, litigation, and regulatory activity regarding our Google Play billing policies and business model, which could \nresult in monetary penalties, damages and/or prohibition.\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these laws, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain and could harm our business. \nFor example:\nz We rely on statutory safe harbors, as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the Communications \nDecency Act in the United States and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, against liability for various linking, caching, and hosting \nactivities. Any legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us. There are legislative proposals in \nboth the US and EU that could reduce our safe harbor protection.\nz Court decisions such as the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on May 13, 2014 on the ‘right to be \nforgotten,’ which allows individuals to demand that Google remove search results about them in certain instances, may limit the \ncontent we can show to our users and impose significant operational burdens.\nThe introduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies, our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions we \ntake may subject us to additional laws and regulations. Our investment in a variety of new fields, such as healthcare and payment \nservices, may expand the scope of regulations that apply to our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations \nare high and are likely to increase in the future. Any failure on our part to comply with laws and regulations can result in negative \npublicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.\nWe are subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings that may harm our business, financial \ncondition, and operating results. \nWe are subject to claims, suits, and government investigations involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, \nconsumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered \nby advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Due to our manufacturing and sale of an expanded suite of \nproducts, including hardware as well as Google Cloud offerings, we also are subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, \nproduct liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation. We may also be subject to claims \ninvolving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental impacts, or service disruptions or failures.\nAny of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, \nnegative publicity and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires \nsignificant judgment. The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, additional \nsubstantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content. \nOur products and services let users exchange information, advertise products and services, conduct business, and engage in various \nonline activities. We also place advertisements displayed on other companies’ websites, and we offer third-party products, services, \nand/or content. The law relating to the liability of online service providers for others’ activities on their services is still somewhat \nunsettled around the world. Claims have been brought against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright and \ntrademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, torts, fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature and content of \ninformation available on or via our services.\nWe may be subject to claims by virtue of our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to content \ncreated by third parties. Defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management \nand other resources, may result in monetary liabilities or penalties, and may require us to change our business in an adverse manner.\n\n14\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nPrivacy and data protection regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Adverse interpretations of these laws could \nharm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nAuthorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data \nprotection and limits on encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation could result in fines and orders \nrequiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to provide services, harming our \nbusiness operations. Complying with these evolving laws could result in substantial costs and harm the quality of our products and \nservices, negatively affecting our business, and may be particularly challenging during certain times, such as a natural disaster or \npandemic (including COVID-19).\nRecent legal developments in Europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from Europe to \nthe United States. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to all of our activities conducted from an \nestablishment in the EU or related to products and services that we offer to EU users or customers, or the monitoring of their behavior \nin the EU. The GDPR creates a range of new compliance obligations.\nEnsuring compliance with the GDPR is an ongoing commitment that involves substantial costs, and despite our efforts, governmental \nauthorities or others have asserted and may continue to assert that our business practices fail to comply with its requirements. \nIf our operations are found to violate GDPR requirements, we may incur substantial fines, have to change our business practices, \nand face reputational harm, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. In particular, serious breaches of the GDPR \ncan result in administrative fines of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenues. Fines of up to 2% of annual worldwide revenues can \nbe levied for other specified violations.\nThe EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks allow U.S. companies that self-certify to the U.S. Department of Commerce \nand publicly commit to comply with specified requirements to import personal data from the EU and Switzerland. Recently, the CJEU \nruled that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield is an invalid transfer mechanism, but upheld Standard Contractual Clauses as a valid transfer \nmechanism, provided they meet certain requirements. The validity of data transfer mechanisms remains subject to legal, regulatory, \nand political developments in both Europe and the U.S., such as recent recommendations from the European Data Protection Board, \nthe invalidation of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and potential invalidation of other data transfer mechanisms, which could have a \nsignificant adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the EEA.\nThese developments create some uncertainty, and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or harm the operations of \nour products and services in ways that harm our business.\nWe face, and may continue to face intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend, result in significant \ndamage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future. \nWe, like other internet, technology and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or \nother violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent-holding companies may frequently seek to generate income from \npatents they have obtained by bringing claims against us. As we have grown, the number of intellectual property claims against us \nhas increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products, services, and technologies.\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our \nproducts, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Other parties have also sought broad injunctive \nrelief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion \nand cease-and-desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell our products or services in the U.S. or elsewhere if our products or \nservices or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims. Adverse results \nin any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are available \nat all), or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. They may also cause us to change \nour business practices and require development of non-infringing products, services, or technologies, which could result in a loss of \nrevenues for us and otherwise harm our business.\nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend against certain intellectual \nproperty infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, \nwhich could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such \nclaims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of \ninjunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business. Moreover, intellectual property \nindemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers \narising from intellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in \nthe future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual property claims.\nRegardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. To the extent such \nclaims are successful, they may harm our business, including our product and service offerings, financial condition, or operating results.\n\n15\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, \nand share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves. \nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class C capital stock from time to time in accordance with authorizations from the Board of \nDirectors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any \nspecific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. Further, our share repurchases could affect our share trading \nprices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a \ndecrease in the trading prices of our stock.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters. \nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A common stock has one vote per share, and our Class C capital stock \nhas no voting rights. As of December 31, 2020, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 85.3% of our outstanding \nClass B common stock, which represented approximately 51.5% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Through their \nstock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election \nof directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable \nfuture. In addition, because our Class C capital stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the \nClass C capital stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could \ncontinue Larry and Sergey’s current relative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome \nof most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’ \nability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could \nreduce the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider \nfavorable.\nProvisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or \nchanges in our management. These provisions include the following:\nz Our certificate of incorporation provides for a tri-class capital stock structure. As a result of this structure, Larry and Sergey have \nsignificant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate \ntransactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others \nfrom initiating any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial. \nAs noted above, the issuance of the Class C capital stock could have the effect of continuing the influence of Larry and Sergey.\nz Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the \nresignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors.\nz Our stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would \nnot be able to take certain actions without holding a stockholders’ meeting.\nz Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority stockholders \nto elect director candidates.\nz Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to propose matters \nthat can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting \na solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\nz Our Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock. The ability to issue \nundesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or \npreferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may \nnot engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the \nstock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the transaction. Our Board of Directors could rely \non Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\n\n16\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nGeneral Risks\nThe continuing impacts of COVID-19 are highly unpredictable and could be significant, and may have an adverse effect on our \nbusiness, operations and our future financial performance. \nSince COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, governments and municipalities around the \nworld have instituted measures in an effort to control the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, school \nclosings, travel restrictions, and closure of non-essential businesses. The macroeconomic impacts on our business continue to \nevolve and be unpredictable and may continue to adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance. As a result of \nthe scale of the ongoing pandemic and the speed at which the global community has been impacted, our revenue growth rate and \nexpense as a percentage of our revenues in future periods may differ significantly from our historical rate, and our future operating \nresults may fall below expectations. \nThe future impacts of the ongoing pandemic on our business, operations and future financial performance could include, but are \nnot limited to:\nz Significant decline in advertising revenues as advertiser spending slows due to an economic downturn. This decline in advertising \nrevenues could persist through and beyond a recessionary period. In addition, we may experience a significant and prolonged shift \nin user behavior such as a shift in interests to less commercial topics.\nz Significant decline in other revenues due to a decline or shifts in customer demand. For example, if consumer demand for electronics \nsignificantly declines, our hardware revenues could be significantly impacted.\nz Adverse impacts to our operating income, operating margin, net income, EPS and respective growth rates – particularly if expenses \ndo not decrease across Alphabet at the same pace as revenue declines. Many of our expenses are less variable in nature and/\nor may not correlate to changes in revenues, including costs associated with our data centers and facilities as well as employee \ncompensation. As such, we may not be able to decrease them significantly in the short-term, or we may choose not to significantly \nreduce them in an effort to remain focused on long-term outlook and investment opportunities.\nz Significant decline in our operating cash flows as a result of decreased advertiser spending and deterioration in the credit quality \nand liquidity of our customers, which could adversely affect our accounts receivable. Investing cash flows could decrease due \nto slowing spend on data center and facilities construction projects due to a slowing or stopping of construction or significant \nrestrictions placed on construction.\nz The prolonged and broad-based shift to a remote working environment continues to create inherent productivity, connectivity, \nand oversight challenges and could affect our ability to enhance, develop and support existing products and services, detect and \nprevent spam and problematic content, hold product sales and marketing events, and generate new sales leads, among others. \nIn addition, the changed environment under which we are operating could have an effect on our internal controls over financial \nreporting as well as our ability to meet a number of our compliance requirements in a timely or quality manner. Additional and/\nor extended, governmental lockdowns, restrictions or new regulations could significantly impact the ability of our employees and \nvendors to work productively. Governmental restrictions have been globally inconsistent and it remains unclear when a return to \nworksite locations or travel will be permitted or what restrictions will be in place in those environments. As we prepare to return \nour workforce in more locations back to the office in 2021, we may experience increased costs as we prepare our facilities for a \nsafe return to work environment and experiment with hybrid work models, in addition to potential effects on our ability to compete \neffectively and maintain our corporate culture.\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of \nexpectations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control. \nAs a result, comparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis \nmay not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our operating results \nin future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed \nunder this Item 1A in addition to the following factors may affect our operating results:\nz Our ability to attract user and/or customer adoption of, and generate significant revenues from, new products, services, and \ntechnologies in which we have invested considerable time and resources.\nz Our ability to monetize traffic on Google Search & other properties, YouTube and our Google Network Members’ properties across \nvarious devices.\n\n17\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nz The amount and timing of operating costs and expenses and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of \nour businesses, operations, and infrastructure.\nz Our focus on long-term goals over short-term results.\nz The results of our acquisitions, divestitures, and our investments in risky projects, including new businesses, products, services, \nand technologies.\nz Our ability to keep our products and services operational at a reasonable cost and without service interruptions.\nz The seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising spending, and underlying business trends such as traditional retail \nseasonality. Our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our growth rate has slowed, \nthe cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate.\nz Geopolitical events, including trade disputes.\nz Changes in global business or macroeconomic conditions.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences \nthat may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, \nand these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter \ninto discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic transactions, which could create unforeseen operating difficulties \nand expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include:\nz Diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic \ntransactions.\nz Failure to successfully integrate and further develop the acquired business or technology.\nz Implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company.\nz Integration of the acquired company’s accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, \nengineering, and sales and marketing functions.\nz Transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms.\nz Failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon approval \nthat could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the \nexpected financial or strategic goals of a transaction.\nz In the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the \nparticular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\nz Cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of \nemployees from the businesses we acquire.\nz Liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, data \nprivacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities.\nz Litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, \nformer stockholders, or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic \ntransactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.\nOur acquisitions and other strategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of \ndebt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring \ncharges, any of which could harm our financial condition or operating results. Also, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions \nand other strategic transactions may not materialize. In connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, \nto provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, which may harm our financial condition or operating results.\nIf we were to lose the services of key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy. \nOur future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. For instance, \nSundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of Alphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of \nour technology, maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will \nemployees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business.\n\n18\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or \nmaintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively. \nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our ability to compete effectively and our \nfuture success depends on our continuing to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our \norganization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted \nour employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in \nattracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes \nmay also impact our ability to hire, mobilize or retain some of our global talent. \nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows and \nevolves, we may need to implement more complex organizational management structures or adapt our corporate culture and work \nenvironments to ever-changing circumstances, such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic (including COVID-19), and \nthese changes could impact our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse impact on our corporate culture.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial statements \nincorporate valuation methodologies that are subjective in nature resulting in fluctuations over time. \nThe market value of our investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial \nresults of the underlying entities, foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates, including changes that may result from the \nimplementation of new benchmark rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors. \nThe effect of COVID-19 on our impairment assessment for non-marketable investments requires significant judgment due to the \nuncertainty around the duration and severity of the impact.\nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt investments, certain other instruments including stock-based compensation \nawards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, at fair value \non a nonrecurring basis. The determination of fair value involves use of appropriate valuation methods and certain unobservable \ninputs, require management judgment and estimation, and may change over time.\nWe adjust the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments to fair value for observable transactions of identical or similar \ninvestments of the same issuer or for impairments. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, \nare recognized in other income (expense), which increases the volatility of our other income (expense). The unrealized gains and \nlosses we record on our non-marketable equity securities in any particular period may differ significantly from the realized gains or \nlosses we ultimately experience on such investments. \nAs a result of these factors, the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents, as well as our marketable and non-marketable securities \ncould decline and result in a material impairment, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional \ntax liabilities. \nOur future income taxes could be negatively affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory \ntax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, the net gains and losses recognized by legal \nentities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management \nprogram, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in \ntax laws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws), as well as certain discrete items.\nIn addition, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have received, \nand may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including in Europe, on various tax-related assertions, such as \ntransfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative \neffect on our operating results and financial condition and could require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to \nour business. It may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, resulting in the diversion of management’s time \nand attention. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant \njudgment, and there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we \nbelieve our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements \nand may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to \nsignificant changes in ways that impair our financial results. Various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering \ndigital services taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes. The Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recently released proposals relating to its initiative for modernizing international \ntax rules, with the goal of having different countries implement a modernized and aligned international tax framework, but there can \nbe no guarantee that this will occur.\n\n19\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS\nIn addition, in response to significant market volatility and disruptions to business operations resulting from the global spread of \nCOVID-19, legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may propose changes to their tax rules. These \nchanges could include modifications that have temporary effect, and more permanent changes. The impact of these potential new \nrules on us, our long-term tax planning, and our effective tax rate could be material.\nThe trading price for our Class A common stock and non-voting Class C capital stock may continue to be volatile. \nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile. \nIn addition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading price of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock may \nfluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, among others announcements by \nus or our competitors of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or \ncapital commitments; recommendations by securities analysts or changes in their earnings estimates; announcements about our \nor our competitors’ earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations, the risk of which is enhanced, in our case, because it is \nour policy not to give guidance on earnings; commentary by industry and market professionals about our products, strategies, and \nother matters affecting our business and results, regardless of its accuracy; the volume of shares of Class A common stock and \nClass C capital stock available for public sale; sales of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock by us or by our stockholders \n(including sales by our directors, executive officers, and other employees); short sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions on \nshares of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock; the size, timing and share class of any share repurchase program; \nand the perceived values of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock relative to one another.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, which can be affected by various factors, including overall economic and political conditions, \nand the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been \nunrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.\nThese broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock, \nregardless of our actual operating performance.\n\n20\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART I\nITEM 1B  UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n—\nITEM 1B.

We seek to expand our products and services to stay \nin front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.\nWe generate our advertising revenues increasingly from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats, and \nthe margins from the advertising revenues from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from \ntraditional desktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our revenues may be affected. \nFor example, growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors, including increased market saturation in \ndeveloped countries, which can affect our mobile advertising revenue growth rates. \nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network Members to increase as our revenues grow and to be affected \nby changes in device mix; geographic mix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid \naccess points; product mix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms. \nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenue growth rates and put pressure on our overall margins.\nz As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings which may affect our monetization.\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand and evolve our \nproduct offerings to serve their changing needs. Over time, we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate. For example, we have \nseen an increase in YouTube ads and Google Play ads, which monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads.\nz As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase \nand movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues.\nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., including in emerging \nmarkets, such as India, where we continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising \nprograms useful to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased revenues from international markets over time, \nas regions with emerging markets, such as APAC, have demonstrated higher revenue growth rates. We expect that our results will \ncontinue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This \ntrend could impact our margins as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\nOur international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange \nrates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to \nthese fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\nz The portion of our revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may affect margins.\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings to our \nusers through products and services like Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware products, and YouTube subscriptions. Across these \ninitiatives, we currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and \nhardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud services and subscription and other services. The \n\n25\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nmargins on these revenues vary significantly and may be lower than the margins on our advertising revenues. A number of our Other \nBets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such, the sources of revenues from these businesses could change \nover time and the revenues could be volatile.\nz As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.\nWe continue to make significant R&D investments in areas of strategic focus such as advertising, cloud, machine learning, and search, \nas well as in new products and services. In addition, we expect to continue to invest in land and buildings for data centers and offices, \nand information technology assets, which includes servers and network equipment, to support the long-term growth of our business.\nIn addition, acquisitions and strategic investments are an important part of our strategy and use of capital, contributing to the breadth \nand depth of our offerings, expanding our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and building strong partnerships around \nstrategic initiatives. For example, in 2020 we announced our Google for India Digitization Fund to invest approximately $10 billion \ninto India over the next 5-7 years through a mix of equity investments, partnerships, and operational, infrastructure and ecosystem \ninvestments.\nz We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws and public policies, which could impact our business practices \nand financial results.\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and \nrelated legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, for \nexample the recent antitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General as well as \nthe News Media Bargaining Code drafted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, our cost of doing business may \nincrease and our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited.\nz Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees \naround the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs to our employees.\nThe Impact of COVID-19 on our Results and Operations\nIn late 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 emerged and by March 11, 2020 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health \nOrganization. Across the United States and the world, governments and municipalities instituted measures in an effort to control the \nspread of COVID-19, including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, school closings, travel restrictions and the closure of non-essential \nbusinesses. The macroeconomic impacts of COVID-19 are significant and continue to evolve, as exhibited by, among other things, \na rise in unemployment, changes in consumer behavior, and market volatility. \nWe began to observe the impact of COVID-19 and the related reductions in global economic activity on our financial results in March \n2020 when, despite an increase in users’ search activity, our advertising revenues declined compared to the prior year due to a shift \nof user search activity to less commercial topics and reduced spending by our advertisers. During the course of the quarter ended \nJune 30, 2020, we observed a gradual return in user search activity to more commercial topics, followed by increased spending by \nour advertisers that continued throughout the second half of 2020.\nWe continue to assess the realized and potential credit deterioration of our customers due to changes in the macroeconomic \nenvironment, which has been reflected in our allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable. Additionally, over the course of \nthe year we experienced variability in our margins as many of our expenses are less variable in nature and/or may not correlate to \nchanges in revenues, including costs associated with our data centers and facilities as well as employee compensation. Also, market \nvolatility has contributed to fluctuations in the valuation of our equity investments.\nWhile we continued to make investments in land and buildings for data centers, offices and information technology, in 2020 we \nslowed the pace of our investments, primarily as it relates to office facilities, as a result of COVID-19.\nThe ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business continues to evolve and be unpredictable. For example, to the extent the pandemic \ndisrupts economic activity globally we, like other businesses, are not immune to continued adverse impacts to our business, operations \nand financial results from volatility in advertising spending, changes in user behavior and preferences, credit deterioration and liquidity \nof our customers, depressed economic activity, or volatility in capital markets. The ongoing impact will depend on a number of \nfactors, including the duration and severity of the pandemic; the uneven impact to certain industries; advances in testing, treatment \nand prevention including vaccines; and the macroeconomic impact of government measures to contain the spread of the virus and \nrelated government stimulus measures. \nTo address the potential impact to our business, over the near-term, we continue to evaluate the pace of our investment plans, \nincluding, but not limited to, our hiring, investments in data centers, servers, network equipment, real estate and facilities, marketing \nand travel spending, as well as taking certain measures to support our customers, our overall workforce, and communities we \noperate in. As we look to return our workforce in more locations back to the office in 2021, we may experience increased costs as \n\n26\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nwe prepare our facilities for a safe return to work environment and experiment with hybrid work models.

See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 \nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nz Total revenues were $182.5 billion, an increase of 13% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in Google Services segment \nrevenues of $16.8 billion or 11% and an increase in Google Cloud segment revenues of $4.1 billion or 46%. Revenues from the \nUnited States, EMEA, APAC, and Other Americas were $85.0 billion, $55.4 billion, $32.6 billion, and $9.4 billion, respectively.\nz Total cost of revenues was $84.7 billion, an increase of 18% year over year. TAC was $32.8 billion, an increase of 9% year over year, \nprimarily driven by an increase in revenues subject to TAC. Other cost of revenues were $51.9 billion, an increase of 24% year over \nyear, primarily driven by an increase in data centers and other operations costs and content acquisition costs.\nz Operating expenses were $56.6 billion, an increase of 5% year over year primarily driven by headcount growth and partially offset \nby declines in advertising and promotional expenses and travel and entertainment expenses.\nOther information:\nz Operating cash flow was $65.1 billion.\nz Capital expenditures, which primarily included investments in technical infrastructure, were $22.3 billion.\nz Number of employees was 135,301 as of December 31, 2020. The majority of new hires during the year were engineers and \nproduct managers.\nOur Segments\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, we report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets: \nz Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and \nYouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, \nand hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\nz Google Cloud includes Google’s infrastructure and data analytics platforms, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise \ncustomers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from fees received for Google Cloud Platform (“GCP”) services and Google \nWorkspace (formerly known as G Suite) collaboration tools.\n\n27\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nz Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from the Other Bets are \nderived primarily through the sale of internet services as well as licensing and R&D services.\nUnallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and legal, including fines \nand settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared research and development activities. Additionally, hedging gains \n(losses) related to revenue are included in corporate costs.\nFinancial Results\nRevenues\nThe following table presents our revenues by type (in millions).\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019\n2020\nGoogle Search & other\n$\n98,115 \n$\n104,062 \nYouTube ads\n15,149 \n19,772 \nGoogle Network Members’ properties\n21,547 \n23,090 \nGoogle advertising\n134,811 \n146,924 \nGoogle other\n17,014 \n21,711 \nGoogle Services total\n151,825 \n168,635 \nGoogle Cloud\n8,918 \n13,059 \nOther Bets\n659\n657\nHedging gains (losses)\n455 \n176 \nTotal revenues\n$\n161,857 \n$\n182,527 \nGoogle Services\nGOOGLE ADVERTISING REVENUES\nOur advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search & other properties and the \nchange in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network Members’ properties and the correlation between these items, \nhave been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors, including:\nz advertiser competition for keywords;\nz changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;\nz changes in device mix;\nz changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\nz fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;\nz general economic conditions including the impact of COVID-19;\nz seasonality; and\nz traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels.\nOur advertising revenue growth rate has been affected over time as a result of a number of factors, including challenges in maintaining \nour growth rate as revenues increase to higher levels; changes in our product mix; changes in advertising quality or formats and delivery; \nthe evolution of the online advertising market; increasing competition; our investments in new business strategies; query growth rates; \nand shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues. We also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving \nuser preferences, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices and modalities, our \nability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers, and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.\nGoogle advertising revenues consist primarily of the following:\nz Google Search & other consists of revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by \nsearch distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.) and other Google owned and \noperated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\nz YouTube ads consists of revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\n\n28\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nz Google Network Members’ properties consist of revenues generated on Google Network Members’ properties participating in \nAdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nGoogle Search & other\nGoogle Search & other revenues increased $5,947 million from 2019 to 2020. The overall growth was primarily driven by interrelated \nfactors including increases in search queries resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, \ngrowth in advertiser spending primarily in the second half of the year, and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery. This \nincrease was partially offset by a decline in advertiser spending primarily in the first half of the year driven by the impact of COVID-19.\nYouTube ads\nYouTube ads revenues increased $4,623 million from 2019 to 2020. Growth was primarily driven by our direct response advertising \nproducts, which benefited from improvements to ad formats and delivery and increased advertiser spending. Brand advertising \nproducts also contributed to growth despite revenues being adversely impacted by a decline in advertiser spending primarily in the \nfirst half of the year driven by the impact of COVID-19.\nGoogle Network Members’ properties\nGoogle Network Members’ properties revenues increased $1,543 million from 2019 to 2020. The growth was primarily driven by \nstrength in AdMob and Google Ad Manager. \nUSE OF MONETIZATION METRICS\nPaid clicks for our Google Search & other properties represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users \non Google search properties and other owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play. Historically, \nwe included certain viewed YouTube engagement ads and the related revenues in our paid clicks and cost-per-click monetization \nmetrics. Over time, advertising on YouTube has expanded to multiple advertising formats and the type of viewed engagement ads \nhistorically included in paid clicks and cost-per-click metrics have increasingly covered a smaller portion of YouTube advertising \nrevenues. As a result, we removed these ads and the related revenues from the paid clicks and cost-per-click metrics for the current \nand historical periods presented. The revised metrics provide a better understanding of monetization trends on the properties included \nwithin Google Search & other, as they now more closely correlate with the related changes in revenues.\nImpressions for our Google Network Members’ properties include impressions displayed to users served on Google Network Members’ \nproperties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense and Google Ad Manager.\nCost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we \ncharge advertisers for each engagement by users.\nCost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions and \nrepresents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the \nnumber of paid clicks on our Google Search & other properties and the number of impressions on Google Network Members’ properties \nand for identifying the revenues generated by click activity on our Google Search & other properties and the revenues generated by \nimpression activity on Google Network Members’ properties. \nPaid clicks and cost-per-click\nThe following table presents changes in our paid clicks and cost-per-click (expressed as a percentage):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019\n2020\nPaid clicks change\n23 %\n19 %\nCost-per-click change\n(6)%\n(10)%\nPaid clicks increased from 2019 to 2020 primarily due to an increase in clicks due to interrelated factors, resulting from ongoing \ngrowth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices; continued growth in advertiser activity; and improvements we have \nmade in ad formats and delivery. Growth was also driven by an increase in clicks relating to ads on Google Play. The positive effect \non our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The \ndecrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by reduced advertiser spending in response to COVID-19 primarily during the first half \nof the year. The decrease in cost-per-click was also affected by changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product changes, \nproduct mix, property mix, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.\n\n29\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPaid clicks increased from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to an increase in clicks due to interrelated factors, including an increase in \nsearch queries resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices; continued growth in advertiser \nactivity; and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery. Growth was also driven by an increase in clicks relating to \nads on Google Play. The positive effect on our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the \ncost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The decrease in cost-per-click was driven by changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing \nproduct changes, product mix, property mix, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.\nImpressions and cost-per-impression\nThe following table presents changes in our impressions and cost-per-impression (expressed as a percentage):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020\nImpressions change\n15 %\nCost-per-impression change\n(8)%\nImpressions increased from 2019 to 2020 primarily due to growth in Google Ad Manager. The positive effect on our revenues from \nan increase in impressions was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-impression paid by our advertisers which was driven \nby a reduction in advertiser spending in response to COVID-19, primarily during the first half of the year, as well as the effect of a \ncombination of factors including ongoing product and policy changes and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, \nchanges in device mix, geographic mix, product mix, property mix, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign \ncurrencies.\nGOOGLE OTHER REVENUES\nGoogle other revenues consist primarily of revenues from: \nz Google Play, which includes revenues from sales of apps and in-app purchases (which we recognize net of payout to developers) \nand digital content sold in the Google Play store; \nz hardware, including Google Nest home products, Pixelbooks, Pixel phones and other devices; \nz YouTube non-advertising, including YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions and other services; and\nz other products and services.\nGoogle other revenues increased $4,697 million from 2019 to 2020. The growth was primarily driven by Google Play and YouTube \nnon-advertising. Growth for Google Play was primarily driven by sales of apps and in-app purchases, which benefited from elevated \nuser engagement partially due to the impact of COVID-19. Growth for YouTube non-advertising was primarily driven by an increase \nin paid subscribers. \nOver time, our growth rate for Google other revenues may be affected by the seasonality associated with new product and service \nlaunches as well as market dynamics.\nGoogle Cloud\nOur Google Cloud revenues increased $4,141 million from 2019 to 2020. The growth was primarily driven by GCP followed by our \nGoogle Workspace offerings. Our infrastructure and our data and analytics platform products were the largest drivers of growth in GCP.\nOver time, our growth rate for Google Cloud revenues may be affected by customer usage, market dynamics, as well as new product \nand service launches.\n\n30\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRevenues by Geography\nThe following table presents our revenues by geography as a percentage of revenues, determined based on the addresses of our \ncustomers:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019\n2020\nUnited States\n46 %\n47 %\nEMEA\n31 %\n30 %\nAPAC\n17 %\n18 %\nOther Americas\n6 %\n5 %\nFor further details on revenues by geography, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 \nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUse of Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Percentage Change\nThe effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. Our \ninternational revenues are favorably affected as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably affected \nas the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. Our revenues are also favorably affected by net hedging gains and \nunfavorably affected by net hedging losses.\nWe use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues for financial and \noperational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on \na constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) results helps improve the ability \nto understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core \noperating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. \nWe define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging \nactivities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency \nrevenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging \neffects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in period revenues over prior period revenues \nwhere current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded \nfrom revenues of both periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a \nconstant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are \nnot a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\n31\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents the foreign exchange effect on our international revenues and total revenues (in millions, except \npercentages):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019\n2020\nEMEA revenues\n$\n50,645\n$\n55,370\nExclude foreign exchange effect on current period revenues using prior year rates\n2,397\n(111)\nEMEA constant currency revenues\n$\n53,042 \n$\n55,259 \nPrior period EMEA revenues\n$\n44,739 \n$\n50,645 \nEMEA revenue percentage change\n13 %\n9 %\nEMEA constant currency revenue percentage change\n19 %\n9 %\nAPAC revenues\n$\n26,928\n$\n32,550\nExclude foreign exchange effect on current period revenues using prior year rates\n388\n11\nAPAC constant currency revenues\n$\n27,316 \n$\n32,561 \nPrior period APAC revenues\n$\n21,341 \n$\n26,928 \nAPAC revenue percentage change\n26 %\n21 %\nAPAC constant currency revenue percentage change\n28 %\n21 %\nOther Americas revenues\n$\n8,986\n$\n9,417\nExclude foreign exchange effect on current period revenues using prior year rates\n541\n964\nOther Americas constant currency revenues\n$\n9,527 \n$\n10,381 \nPrior period Other Americas revenues\n$\n7,608 \n$\n8,986 \nOther Americas revenue percentage change\n18 %\n5 %\nOther Americas constant currency revenue percentage change\n25 %\n16 %\nUnited States revenues\n$\n74,843\n$\n85,014\nUnited States revenue percentage change\n18%\n14%\nHedging gains (losses)\n455\n176\nTotal revenues\n$\n161,857 \n$\n182,527 \nTotal constant currency revenues\n$\n164,728 \n$\n183,215 \nPrior period revenues, excluding hedging effect(1)\n$\n136,957 \n$\n161,402 \nTotal revenue percentage change\n18 %\n13 %\nTotal constant currency revenue percentage change\n20 %\n14 %\n(1) Total revenues and hedging gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $136,819 million and $(138) million, respectively.\nEMEA revenue percentage change from 2019 to 2020 was not significantly affected by foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due \nto the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Euro offset by the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish lira and Russian ruble.\nAPAC revenue percentage change from 2019 to 2020 was not significantly affected by foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due \nto the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Indian rupee, partially offset by the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Japanese yen.\nOther Americas revenue percentage change from 2019 to 2020 was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange \nrates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Brazilian real and Argentine peso. \n\n32\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCosts and Operating Expenses\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues includes TAC which are paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services, \nand amounts paid to Google Network Members primarily for ads displayed on their properties. Our distribution partners include \nbrowser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers.\nThe cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network Members’ properties are significantly \nhigher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google properties (which includes \nGoogle Search & other and YouTube ads), because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network Members’ \nproperties are paid as TAC to our Google Network Members.\nAdditionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding TAC) includes the following:\nz Content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for \ndistribution on YouTube advertising and subscription services and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on \nrevenues generated or a flat fee);\nz Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses including stock-based compensation \n(“SBC”), depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review and customer \nsupport costs). These costs are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate with related changes in revenues; and\nz Inventory related costs for hardware we sell.  \nThe following tables present our cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, except percentages):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019\n2020\nTAC\n$\n30,089\n$\n32,778 \nOther cost of revenues\n41,807\n51,954 \nTotal cost of revenues\n$\n71,896\n$\n84,732\nTotal cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues\n44.4%\n46.4%\nCost of revenues increased $12,836 million from 2019 to 2020. The increase was due to increases in other cost of revenues and \nTAC of $10,147 million and $2,689 million, respectively. \nThe increase in other cost of revenues from 2019 to 2020 was due to an increase in data center and other operations costs and an \nincrease in content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube. This increase was partially offset by a decline in hardware costs.\nThe increase in TAC from 2019 to 2020 was due to increases in TAC paid to distribution partners and to Google Network Members, \ndriven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate was 22.3% in both 2019 and 2020. The TAC rate on Google properties \nrevenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially consistent from 2019 to 2020.\nOver time, cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues may be affected by a number of factors, including the following:\nz The amount of TAC paid to distribution partners, which is affected by changes in device mix, geographic mix, partner mix, partner \nagreement terms such as revenue share arrangements, and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points;\nz The amount of TAC paid to Google Network Members, which is affected by a combination of factors such as geographic mix, \nproduct mix, and revenue share terms;\nz Relative revenue growth rates of Google properties and Google Network Members’ properties;\nz Certain costs that are less variable in nature and may not correlate with the related revenues;\nz Costs associated with our data centers and other operations to support ads, Google Cloud, Search, YouTube and other products;\nz Content acquisition costs, which are primarily affected by the relative growth rates in our YouTube advertising and subscription \nrevenues; \nz Costs related to hardware sales; and\nz Increased proportion of non-advertising revenues, which generally have higher costs of revenues, relative to our advertising revenues.\n\n33\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nResearch and Development\nThe following table presents our R&D expenses (in millions, except percentages):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019\n2020\nResearch and development expenses\n$\n26,018\n$\n27,573 \nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of revenues\n16.1 %\n15.1 %\nR&D expenses consist primarily of:\nz Compensation expenses (including SBC) for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D of our existing and new \nproducts and services; \nz Depreciation expenses; \nz Equipment-related expenses; and\nz Professional services fees primarily related to consulting and outsourcing services.\nR&D expenses increased $1,555 million from 2019 to 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expenses \nof $1,619 million, largely resulting from a 11% increase in headcount and partially offset by higher compensation charges in certain \nOther Bets in 2019. Additionally, the increase in R&D expenses was partially offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses \nof $383 million. \nOver time, R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues may fluctuate due to certain expenses that are generally less variable in nature \nand may not correlate to the changes in revenues. In addition, R&D expenses may be affected by a number of factors including \ncontinued investment in ads, Android, Chrome, Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware, machine learning, Other Bets, Search and \nYouTube.\nSales and Marketing\nThe following table presents our sales and marketing expenses (in millions, except percentages):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019\n2020\nSales and marketing expenses\n$\n18,464\n$\n17,946\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues\n11.4%\n9.8%\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of:\nz Advertising and promotional expenditures related to our products and services; and\nz Compensation expenses (including SBC) for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer \nservice functions.\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $518 million from 2019 to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in advertising \nand promotional expenses of $1,395 million, as we reduced spending and paused or rescheduled campaigns and changed some \nevents to digital-only formats as a result of COVID-19, and a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses of $371 million. The \ndecrease was partially offset by an increase in compensation expenses of $1,347 million, largely resulting from an 8% increase in \nheadcount.\nOver time, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues may fluctuate due to certain expenses that are generally less \nvariable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenues.

Additionally, there was an increase in operating expenses primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses \n(including SBC) largely due to an increase in headcount.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle Cloud operating loss increased $962 million from 2019 to 2020 and increased $297 million from 2018 to 2019. The increase \nin operating loss in both periods was driven by an increase in total expenses of $5,103 million from 2019 to 2020 and $3,377 million \nfrom 2018 to 2019. Operating expenses increased primarily due to compensation expenses (including SBC), largely driven by an \nincrease in headcount. Additionally, data center and other operating costs increased in both periods.\nOther Bets\nOther Bets operating loss decreased $348 million from 2019 to 2020 and increased $1,466 million from 2018 to 2019. The fluctuations \nwere primarily driven by compensation expenses (including SBC).\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents other income (expense), net, (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019\n2020\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n5,394 \n$\n6,858 \nOther income (expense), net, increased $1,464 million from 2019 to 2020. The change was primarily driven by an increase in net \ngains on equity and debt securities of $3,519 million, partially offset by a $902 million loss resulting from our equity derivatives, \nwhich hedged the changes in fair value of certain marketable equity securities, and a decrease in interest income of $562 million.\nOver time, other income (expense), net, may be affected by market dynamics and other factors. Equity values generally change daily \nfor marketable equity securities and upon the occurrence of observable price changes or upon impairment of non-marketable equity \nsecurities. In addition, volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets, including the effects of COVID-19, could result in \na significant change in the value of our investments. Fluctuations in the value of these investments has, and we expect will continue \nto, contribute to volatility of OI&E in future periods. For additional information about our investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table presents our provision for income taxes (in millions, except for effective tax rate):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019\n2020\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n5,282\n$\n7,813 \nEffective tax rate\n13.3 %\n16.2 %\nOur provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate increased from 2019 to 2020. The increase in the provision for income \ntaxes and our effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits related to the resolution of multi-year audits in 2019 that did not recur in \n2020, higher earnings in countries that have higher statutory rates resulting from the change in our corporate legal entity structure \nimplemented as of December 31, 2019, and an increase in valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets that are not likely to be \nrealized relating to certain of our Other Bets, partially offset by an increase in the U.S. federal Foreign-Derived Intangible Income tax \ndeduction benefits. \n\n36\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSee Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for \nfurther information.\nWe expect our future effective tax rate to be affected by the geographic mix of earnings in countries with different statutory rates. \nAdditionally, our future effective tax rate may be affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes \nin tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables presenting our quarterly results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial \nstatements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have prepared the unaudited \ninformation on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. Our operating results for any quarter are not \nnecessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year. \nThe following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2020. This \ntable includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for a fair presentation \nof our consolidated financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. Seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and \nadvertiser expenditures, underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality and macroeconomic conditions have \naffected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business (including developments and volatility arising from COVID-19). Commercial \nqueries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year.

The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our \ncash and capital structure, including the size, pace and form of capital return to stockholders.\n\n37\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019\n2020\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n54,520 \n$\n65,124 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(29,491)\n$\n(32,773)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n$\n(23,209)\n$\n(24,408)\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by our operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search & other properties, \nGoogle Network Members’ properties and YouTube ads. Additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps, in-app purchases, \ndigital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees including fees received for Google Cloud offerings and \nsubscription-based products.\nOur primary uses of cash from our operating activities include compensation and related costs, payments to our distribution partners \nand Google Network Members, and payments for content acquisition costs. In addition, uses of cash from operating activities include \nhardware inventory costs, income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from 2019 to 2020 primarily due to the net effect of increases in cash received \nfrom revenues and cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses, and changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of our investments in marketable and non-marketable \nsecurities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and non-marketable securities, purchases \nof property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from 2019 to 2020 primarily due to a net increase in purchases of securities, partially \noffset by decreases in payments for acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. The net decrease in purchases of \nproperty and equipment was driven by decreases in purchases of land and buildings for offices as well as data center construction, \npartially offset by increases in purchases of servers.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of interest in \nconsolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of capital stock, net payments related to \nstock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from 2019 to 2020 primarily due to an increase in cash payments for repurchases of \ncapital stock, partially offset by increases in net proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of interest in consolidated \nentities.\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and financing activities to \ncontinue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the \nnext 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had long-term taxes payable of $6.5 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a \nresult of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”). As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free \ninstallments through 2025.\nIn 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition law and \nimposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018), and €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion \nas of March 20, 2019), respectively. While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other \ncurrent liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. \nIn January 2021, we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, a leading wearables brand, for $2.1 billion.\n\n38\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from \nthis program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2020, we had no commercial paper outstanding. As of \nDecember 31, 2020, we have $4.0 billion of revolving credit facilities expiring in July 2023 with no amounts outstanding. The interest \nrate for the credit facilities is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. \nIn August 2020, we issued $10.0 billion of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in six tranches: $1.0 billion due in 2025, $1.0 billion due \nin 2027, $2.25 billion due in 2030, $1.25 billion due in 2040, $2.5 billion due in 2050 and $2.0 billion due in 2060. The 2020 Notes \nhad a weighted average duration of 21.5 years and weighted average coupon rate of 1.57%. Of the total issuance, $5.75 billion was \ndesignated as Sustainability Bonds, the net proceeds of which are used to fund environmentally and socially responsible projects \nin the following eight areas: energy efficiency, clean energy, green buildings, clean transportation, circular economy and design, \naffordable housing, commitment to racial equity, and support for small businesses and COVID-19 crisis response. The remaining \nnet proceeds are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2020, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding with \na total carrying value of $13.8 billion. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 \nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the debts.\nIn accordance with the authorizations of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, in 2020 we repurchased and subsequently retired \n21.5 million shares of Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of $31.1 billion. As of December 31, 2020, $17.6 billion \nremains authorized and available for repurchase. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business \nand market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, \nincluding through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to \nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\nWe make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets through purchases of \nproperty and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products. \nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\nz Technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for compute, storage and networking \nrequirements for ongoing business activities, including machine learning, (collectively referred to as our information technology \nassets) and data center land and building construction; and\nz Office facilities, ground up development projects and related building improvements.\nDue to the integrated nature of Alphabet, our technical infrastructure and office facilities are managed centrally at a consolidated \nlevel. The associated costs, including depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally \nbased on usage or headcount. Our technical infrastructure investments are designed to support all of Alphabet, including primarily \nads, Google Cloud, Search, and YouTube.\nConstruction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been placed in service \nfor our intended use. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend to multiple periods. \nFor example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple phases, where we acquire qualified \nland and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information technology assets. \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we spent $23.5 billion and $22.3 billion on capital expenditures and recognized \ntotal operating lease assets of $4.4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the amount of total future lease \npayments under operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 9 years, was $15.1 billion. As of December 31, \n2020, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $8.0 billion, excluding purchase \noptions, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2021 and 2026 with \nnon-cancelable lease terms of 1 to 25 years.\nDepreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our \nintended use. Land is not depreciated. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, our depreciation and impairment expenses \non property and equipment were $10.9 billion and $12.9 billion, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs), were $2.4 billion \nand $2.9 billion, respectively. Finance leases were not material for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.

Excluded from the table above are long-term taxes payable of \n$2.3 billion as of December 31, 2020 primarily related to uncertain tax positions, for which we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the \ntiming of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing and outcomes of tax audits.\n(5) Represents cash obligations recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities, primarily for \ncertain commercial agreements. These amounts do not include the EC fines which are classified as current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nFor further information regarding the EC fines, refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual \nReport on Form 10-K.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, \nthat have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, \nrevenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors. See \nNote 10 included in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information on our commitments and contingencies.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions \nthat affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, gains and losses, as well as related disclosure of contingent \nassets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, \nchanges in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ \nmaterially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our \nfinancial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that \nwe believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting \nestimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. We have reviewed our critical \naccounting policies and estimates with the audit and compliance committee of our Board of Directors.\nPlease see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary \nof significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.\nRevenues\nFor the sale of third-party goods and services, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenues on a gross basis, or an \nagent, and report revenues on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services \nbefore they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory \nrisk, and discretion in establishing price.\n\n40\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax \npositions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nAlthough we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax \noutcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the \nclosing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the \namounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such \ndetermination is made.\nThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as \nwell as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by \nthe Internal Revenue Services (“IRS”) and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the \nlikelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision \nfor income taxes.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition, intellectual property, \nprivacy, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services \noffered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these \nmatters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is \nprobable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible \nand the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously \naccrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures \nas appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss \nrelated to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, \nand such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could \nhave a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nLong-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment, long-term prepayments, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are reviewed \nfor impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. \nThe evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss would \nbe recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount. \nMeasurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt investments, certain other instruments including stock-based compensation \nawards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, at fair value \non a nonrecurring basis. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation methods and relevant inputs into \nvaluation models. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value whereby it gives the highest priority to \nquoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. We \nmaximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Our use of unobservable inputs \nreflects the assumptions that market participants would use and may include our own data adjusted based on reasonably available \ninformation. We apply judgment in assessing the relevance of observable market data to determine the priority of inputs under the \nfair value hierarchy, particularly in situations where there is very little or no market activity.\nIn determining the fair values of our non-marketable equity and debt investments, as well as assets acquired (especially with respect \nto intangible assets) and liabilities assumed in business combinations, we make significant estimates and assumptions, some of \nwhich include the use of unobservable inputs.\nCertain stock-based compensation awards may be settled in the stock of certain of our Other Bets or in cash. These awards are \nbased on the equity values of the respective Other Bet, which requires use of unobservable inputs.\nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized investment returns, i.e. performance fees. We recognize \ncompensation expense based on the estimated payouts, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are \nrealized, and may require the use of unobservable inputs.\n\n41\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-marketable Equity Securities\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are carried either at fair value or under the \nmeasurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or \nminus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same \nissuer. Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the \nrights and obligations of the securities. Recording upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of our equity securities \nas a result of observable price changes requires quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities using various valuation \nmethodologies and involves the use of estimates.\nNon-marketable equity securities are also subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both \nqualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant effect on the investment’s fair value. Qualitative factors considered \ninclude the companies’ financial and liquidity position, access to capital resources and the time since the last adjustment to fair value, \namong others. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our equity investments \nusing both the market and income approaches which require judgment and the use of estimates, including discount rates, investee \nrevenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. When our assessment indicates \nthat an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its fair value.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn January 2021, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and determined we should \nadjust the estimated useful life of our servers from three years to four years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment \nfrom three years to five years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2021. For assets that are \nin-service as of December 31, 2020, we expect operating results to be favorably impacted by approximately $2.1 billion for the full \nfiscal year 2021. The effect of the change may be different due to our capital investments during the fiscal year 2021.\n\n42\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7A  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n—\nITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES \nABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity investment risks. \nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in \nforeign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Principal currencies \nhedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro and Japanese yen. For the purpose of analyzing foreign \ncurrency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably \npossible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be experienced in the near term.\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies \nother than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign \ncurrency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities \nare recorded in other income (expense), net, which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward contracts.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets, liabilities, and commitments \ndenominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have resulted in an adverse effect \non income before income taxes of approximately $8 million and $497 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, after \nconsideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.\nWe use foreign currency forwards and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased \nand written options) to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. \nWhen the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency options and forwards reduce the foreign currency losses related to our \nearnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign currency collars and forwards offset the foreign currency gains related to \nour earnings. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. \nWe designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot \nrate changes as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur. \nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange \ncontracts before tax effect would have been approximately $1.1 billion and $912 million lower as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, \nrespectively. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in \nforecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our \ninvestment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign \noperations.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (“CTA”) within AOCI related to our net \ninvestment hedge would have been approximately $936 million and $1 billion lower as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. \nThe change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from \nour investment in foreign subsidiaries.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity. We \ninvest primarily in debt securities including those of the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed \nsecurities, money market and other funds, municipal securities, time deposits, asset backed securities, and debt instruments issued \nby foreign governments. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and \nfloating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value \nadversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest \nrates fall. Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared \nto interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for \nwhich changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. We measure securities for which we have not elected the \nfair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold, less any expected credit losses. \n\n43\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 7A  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe use value-at-risk (“VaR”) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of our marketable \ndebt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our investment portfolio due to \nadverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with 95% confidence interval. The estimated one-day \nloss in fair value of our marketable debt securities as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 are shown below (in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n12-Month Average\nAs of December 31,\n2019\n2020\n2019\n2020\nRisk Category - Interest Rate\n$\n104 \n$\n144 \n$\n90 \n$\n145 \nActual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity \nanalyses performed as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and \namount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is not intended to represent actual losses \nbut is used as a risk estimation.\nEquity Investment Risk\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially \nreduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are investments in \nprivately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.\nWe record our marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable \nmarket values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and represent $3.3 billion and \n$5.9 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. A hypothetical adverse price change of 30% on our \nDecember 31, 2020 balance, which could be experienced in the near term, would decrease the fair value of our marketable equity \nsecurities by $1.8 billion. From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable \nequity securities.\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for observable transactions \nfor identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative). The fair value \nmeasured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an indication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet \ndate. These investments, especially those that are in the early stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products \nthese companies have under development are typically in the early phases and may never materialize and they may experience a \ndecline in financial condition, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The success \nof our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the \nvalue of our investments through liquidity events such as public offerings, acquisitions, private sales or other market events. As \nof December 31, 2019 and 2020, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the \nmeasurement alternative, was $11.4 billion and $18.9 billion, respectively. Valuations of our equity investments in private companies \nare inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. Volatility in the global economic climate and financial \nmarkets could result in a significant impairment charge relating to our non-marketable equity securities. Changes in valuation of \nnon-marketable equity securities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities. Additionally, \nobservable transactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses on our non-marketable equity securities. The effect of \nCOVID-19 on our impairment assessment requires significant judgment due to the uncertainty around the duration and severity of \nthe impact.\nThe carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion as of December 31, \n2019 and 2020, respectively, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes, however these investments could be impaired \nif the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.\nFor further information about our equity investments, please refer to Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial \nStatements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n44\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n—\nITEM 8.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY \nDATA\nAlphabet Inc.\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statement\nREPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \n45\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS \n48\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME \n49\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME \n50\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY \n51\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS \n52\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n53\nThe supplementary financial information required by this Item 8 is included in Item 7 under the caption “Quarterly \nResults of Operations.”\n\n45\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nREPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC \nACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alphabet Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and \n2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the \nthree years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at \nItem 15 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements \npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2020, and the results of its \noperations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally \naccepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), \nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control—\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and \nour report dated February 2, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the \nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required \nto be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and \nregulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the \naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to \nerror or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, \nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a \ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the \naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the \nfinancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was \ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are \nmaterial to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication \nof the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we \nare not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts \nor disclosures to which it relates. \n\n46\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES\nDescription \nof the Matter\nThe Company is regularly subject to claims, suits, and government investigations involving competition, \nintellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content \ngenerated by its users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using their platforms, and other \nmatters. As described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements “Commitments and Contingencies” \nsuch claims could result in adverse consequences.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood, and the estimated amount, of a loss related to \nsuch matters. Auditing management’s accounting for and disclosure of loss contingencies from these matters \ninvolved challenging and subjective auditor judgment in assessing the Company’s evaluation of the probability of \na loss, and the estimated amount or range of loss.\nHow We Addressed \nthe Matter in \nOur Audit\nWe tested relevant controls over the identified risks associated with management’s accounting for and disclosure \nof these matters. This included controls over management’s assessment of the probability of incurrence of a loss \nand whether the loss or range of loss was reasonably estimable and the development of related disclosures.\nOur audit procedures included gaining an understanding of previous rulings issued by regulators and the status of \nongoing lawsuits, reviewing letters addressing the matters from internal and external legal counsel, meeting with \ninternal legal counsel to discuss the allegations, and obtaining a representation letter from management on these \nmatters. We also evaluated the Company’s disclosures in relation to these matters.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1999.\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 2, 2021\n\n47\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nREPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC \nACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Alphabet Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 \nframework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Alphabet Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal \ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), \nthe 2020 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 2, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion \nthereon. \nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment \nof the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal \nControl over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting \nbased on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to \nthe Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and \nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit \nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness \nexists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing \nsuch other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for \nour opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability \nof financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted \naccounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain \nto the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets \nof the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial \nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being \nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance \nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a \nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections \nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes \nin conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 2, 2021\n\n48\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1.\nNature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we \nimplemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (“Alphabet”) became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising, cloud-based solutions that provide customers with \nplatforms, collaboration tools and services, and sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, digital \ncontent and subscriptions for digital content, and hardware.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable \ninterest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. \nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States \n(“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements \nand the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our \nestimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses, fair values of financial instruments (including non-marketable \nequity securities), intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, and \ncontingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed \nto be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nAs of December 31, 2020 the impact of COVID-19 continues to unfold and the extent of the impact will depend on a number of \nfactors, including the duration and severity of the pandemic; the uneven impact to certain industries; advances in testing, treatment \nand prevention; and the macroeconomic impact of government measures to contain the spread of the virus and related government \nstimulus measures. As a result, certain of our estimates and assumptions, including the allowance for credit losses for accounts \nreceivable, the credit worthiness of customers entering into revenue arrangements, the valuation of non-marketable equity securities, \nincluding our impairment assessment, and the fair values of our financial instruments require increased judgment and carry a higher \ndegree of variability and volatility that could result in material changes to our estimates in future periods.\nIn January 2021, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and determined we should \nadjust the estimated useful life of our servers from three years to four years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment \nfrom three years to five years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2021.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers and the collectibility of an \namount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from revenues. \nADVERTISING REVENUES\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on Google Search & other properties, including Google.com, the \nGoogle Search app, Google Play, Gmail and Google Maps; YouTube, and Google Network Members’ properties.\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager and Google Marketing Platform, \namong others.\n\n54\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for performance advertising \nwhen a user engages with the advertisement, such as a click, a view, or a purchase. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues \nwhen the ad is displayed or a user views the ad.\nFor ads placed on Google Network Members’ properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross \nbasis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network \nMembers’ properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid \nto Google Network Members are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the advertising inventory \nbefore it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it \nis transferred to our customers, and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of \ndiscretion in establishing pricing.\nGOOGLE CLOUD REVENUES\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist primarily of fees received for Google Cloud Platform services (which includes infrastructure and data \nanalytics platform products and other services) and Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) collaboration tools and other enterprise \nservices. Our cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis. Revenues related to cloud services \nprovided on a consumption basis are recognized when the customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. \nRevenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer \nreceives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services.\nOTHER REVENUES \nGoogle other revenues and Other Bets revenues consist primarily of revenues from:\nz Google Play, which includes revenues from sale of apps and in-app purchases (which we recognize net of payout to developers) \nand digital content sold in the Google Play store;\nz hardware, including Google Nest home products, Pixelbooks, Pixel phones and other devices;\nz YouTube non-advertising services including, YouTube premium and YouTube TV subscriptions and other services; and\nz other products and services.\nAs it relates to Google other revenues, the most significant judgment is determining whether we are the principal or agent for app \nsales and in-app purchases through the Google Play store. We report revenues from these transactions on a net basis because \nour performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a commission. \nConsequently, the portion of the gross amount billed to end users that is remitted to app developers is not reflected as revenues.\nARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenues to each \nperformance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the \nprices charged to customers or using expected cost plus margin.\nCUSTOMER INCENTIVES AND CREDITS\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these \namounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that there will not be significant \nchanges to our estimates of variable consideration.\nSALES COMMISSIONS\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the amortization period is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain \nsales commissions if we expect the period of benefit of these costs to exceed one year and amortize it over the period of expected \nbenefit. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\nCOST OF REVENUES\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\nTAC represents the amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services and amounts \npaid to Google Network Members primarily for ads displayed on their properties. Our distribution partners include browser providers, \nmobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers.\n\n55\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nOther cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding TAC) includes the following:\nz Content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for \ndistribution on YouTube advertising and subscription services and Google Play. We pay fees to these content providers based on \nrevenues generated or a flat fee;\nz Expenses associated with our data centers and other operations (including bandwidth, compensation expense (including SBC), \ndepreciation, energy, and other equipment costs); and\nz Inventory related costs for hardware we sell.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products \nto be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological feasibility is typically \nreached shortly before the release of such products and as a result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were \nnot material for the periods presented.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud based \napplications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary \nproject stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function \nintended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (“RSUs”). RSUs are equity classified and measured at \nthe fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense using the straight-line attribution method \nover the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our \nemployees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding and the tax withholding is recorded as a \nreduction to additional paid-in capital.\nAdditionally, stock-based compensation also includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (“PSUs”) and \nawards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bets. PSUs and certain Other Bet awards are equity classified and \nexpense is recognized over the requisite service period. Certain Other Bet awards are liability classified and remeasured at fair value \nthrough settlement. The fair value of Other Bet awards is based on the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2018, \n2019 and 2020, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $6.4 billion, $6.8 billion, and $5.4 billion, respectively.\nPerformance Fees\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized investment returns. We recognize compensation \nexpense based on the estimated payouts, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized. Performance \nfees, which are primarily related to gains on equity securities, are recorded as a component of other income (expense), net.\nCertain Risks and Concentrations\nOur revenues are primarily derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing. In addition, \nour revenues are generated from a multitude of markets in countries around the world. Significant changes in this industry or changes \nin customer buying or advertiser spending behavior could adversely affect our operating results.\nNo individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2018, 2019, or 2020. In 2018, \n2019, and 2020, we generated approximately 46%, 46%, and 47% of our revenues, respectively, from customers based in the U.S.\nWe are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally from cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign exchange \ncontracts, and accounts receivable. We manage our credit risk exposure through timely assessment of our counterparty \ncreditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management.\n\n56\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nCash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of time deposits, money market and other funds, highly liquid debt \ninstruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, debt instruments issued \nby municipalities in the U.S., corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. Foreign exchange \ncontracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and \nare derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. We perform ongoing evaluations to determine customer \ncredit and we limit the amount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers. \nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, marketable securities, \nderivative contracts, and non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include \nnon-marketable equity securities, which are adjusted to fair value when observable price changes are identified or when the non-\nmarketable equity securities are impaired (referred to as the measurement alternative). Other financial assets and liabilities are carried \nat cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly \ntransaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions \nthat market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and \nclassified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used \nto measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar \ninstruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable \nin the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and \ndiscount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign \nexchange rates, and credit ratings.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs \nwhen measuring fair value. \nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\nWe invest all excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, \ntime deposits, and money market funds.\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have stated maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash \nequivalents and those with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance \nSheets.\nWe determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate \nsuch designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-\nfor-sale. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt \nsecurities prior to their stated maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly \nliquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated \nBalance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of \nstockholders’ equity, except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded in other income (expense), \nnet. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value are recorded in other \nincome (expense), net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a specific identification \nmethod, and we record such gains and losses as a component of other income (expense), net.\nOur investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses, realized and unrealized, \nrecognized in other income (expense), net.\n\n57\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nAccounts Receivable\nOur payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The \nterm between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customers, we require \npayment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. \nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable and changes \nin such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We assess collectibility by \nreviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify \nspecific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we \nconsider historical collectibility based on past due status and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based \non ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider customer-specific information, current market conditions and reasonable and \nsupportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our assessment considered the impact of COVID-19 and estimates of expected credit and \ncollectibility trends. Volatility in market conditions and evolving credit trends are difficult to predict and may cause variability and \nvolatility that may have a material impact on our allowance for credit losses in future periods. The allowance for credit losses on \naccounts receivable was $275 million and $789 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\nInventory\nInventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is computed using \nthe first-in, first-out method.\nNon-Marketable Investments\nWe account for non-marketable equity investments through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the \ninvestee under the equity method. Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are primarily \naccounted for under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value of our non-marketable \nequity investments is adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or \nimpairment. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are recorded as a \ncomponent of other income (expense), net.\nNon-marketable debt investments are classified as available-for-sale securities.\nNon-marketable investments that do not have stated contractual maturity dates are classified as non-current assets on the \nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\nImpairment of Investments\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity investments for impairment. \nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is estimated by considering \navailable information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable \nand supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to other income (expense), net, not to exceed the amount of the \nunrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). \nIf we have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position \nbefore recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as \na component of other income (expense), net. \nFor non-marketable equity securities we consider whether impairment indicators exist by evaluating the companies’ financial and \nliquidity position, access to capital resources and the time since the last adjustment to fair value, among others. If the assessment \nindicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value by recording the corresponding charge as \na component of other income (expense), net. Fair value is estimated using the best information available, which may include cash \nflow projections or other available market data.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other \nvariable interests is considered a variable interest entity (“VIE”). We consolidate VIEs when we are the primary beneficiary. We are the \nprimary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of \n\n58\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nthe VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we \naccount for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the \nentity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. \nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets, construction in progress, \nleasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices, data centers and related building \nimprovements. Information technology assets include servers and network equipment. We account for property and equipment at \ncost less accumulated depreciation. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the \nassets, which we regularly evaluate. We depreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology \nassets generally over periods of three to five years (specifically, three years for servers and three to five years for network equipment).\nWe depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. \nConstruction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service \nfor our intended use. Depreciation for equipment, buildings, and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our \nintended use. Land is not depreciated.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. \nPayments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance \nand utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and account for them together as a single \nlease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and \nliabilities. These amounts include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on wind or solar production \nfor power purchase arrangements, and payments for maintenance and utilities.\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The \ninterest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest \nrate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on \na collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease \nterms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. \nWe generally use the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include \nany prepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet beginning January 1, 2019. The current portion \nof our operating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and the long term portion is included in \noperating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are included in \naccrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nLong-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe review property and equipment, long-term prepayments and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events \nor changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of these assets by \ncomparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. \nIf the carrying value of the assets or asset group are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by \nwhich the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Impairments were not material for the periods presented.\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting \nunits periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill \nusing a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or \nchanges in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We amortize intangible assets on a straight-line \nbasis with definite lives generally over periods ranging from one to twelve years.\n\n59\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable \nfor the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in \nour financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted \ntax law. We evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance \nto reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized.\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical merits, the position \nwill be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based \non the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we \nrecognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price \nof the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase \nprice over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized \nseparately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of \nthese subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period \nderived from month-end exchange rates for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in accumulated \nother comprehensive income (AOCI) as a component of stockholders’ equity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and \nlosses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange \ngain (loss) in other income (expense), net.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 (“ASU 2016-\n13”) “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”, which requires the \nmeasurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing \nincurred loss impairment model with an expected loss model which requires the use of forward-looking information to calculate \ncredit loss estimates. It also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment and requires credit losses related to certain \navailable-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized \ncost basis of the securities. These changes result in earlier recognition of credit losses. We adopted ASU 2016-13 using the modified \nretrospective approach as of January 1, 2020. The cumulative effect upon adoption was not material to our consolidated financial \nstatements.

Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Our total deferred revenue as of December 31, \n2019 was $2.3 billion, of which $1.8 billion was recognized as revenues for the year ending December 31, 2020.\nAdditionally, we have performance obligations associated with commitments in customer contracts, primarily related to Google \nCloud, for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues, also referred to as remaining performance obligations. \nRemaining performance obligations include related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in \nfuture periods, and excludes (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less, (ii) cancellable contracts, and (iii) contracts \nfor which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. As of December 31, \n2020, the amount not yet recognized as revenues from these commitments is $29.8 billion. We expect to recognize approximately \nhalf over the next 24 months with the remaining thereafter. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven \nby when the customer utilizes the services and our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms, which could impact \nour estimate of the remaining performance obligations and when we expect to recognize such as revenues.  \n\n61\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nNote 3.\nFinancial Instruments\nDebt Securities\nWe classify our marketable debt securities, which are accounted for as available-for-sale, within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy \nbecause we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable \ninputs to determine fair value.\nFor certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other \nincome (expense), net.

See Note 7 for further details on other income (expense), net.\nEquity Investments\nThe following discusses our marketable equity securities, non-marketable equity securities, gains and losses on marketable and \nnon-marketable equity securities, as well as our equity securities accounted for under the equity method.\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and 2 in the \nfair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices \nfor similar instruments in active markets.\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The \ncarrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar \ninvestments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative). Non-marketable equity securities that \nhave been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value \nhierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction \nprice at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The \nfair value of non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3.\n\n63\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nGAINS AND LOSSES ON MARKETABLE AND NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES\nGains and losses reflected in other income (expense), net, for our marketable and non-marketable equity securities are summarized \nbelow (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019\n2020\nNet gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period\n$\n(301)\n$\n1,339 \nNet unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities held as of the end of the period\n2,950 \n4,253 \nTotal gain (loss) recognized in other income (expense), net\n$\n2,649 \n$\n5,592 \nIn the table above, net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the sale proceeds and \nthe carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. \nCumulative net gains (losses) on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following table (in millions), \nrepresents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity security. While these net gains may \nhave been reflected in periods prior to the period of sale, we believe they are important supplemental information as they reflect the \neconomic realized net gains on the securities sold during the period.

Our share of gains and losses including impairment are included as a component of other \nincome (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 7 for further details on other income (expense), net.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed with \nderivative instruments is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, \nand investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into \nderivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the \nderivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a \ncombination of purchased and written options) at net fair values where both the purchased and written options are with the same \ncounterparty. For other derivative contracts, we present at gross fair values. We primarily record changes in the fair value in the \nConsolidated Statements of Income as either other income (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in \nAOCI, as discussed below.\nWe enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same \ncounterparty. Further, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or pledged when the \nnet fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Cash collateral received related to \nderivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability. \nCash and non-cash collateral pledged related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in \nother current assets.\n\n65\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nCASH FLOW HEDGES\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted \nrevenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently reclassified \nto revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude the change in forward points and time value from our \nassessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded component is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of \nthe hedging instrument and recognized in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the \namount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding \namounts in AOCI are reclassified to other income (expense), net in the period of de-designation.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the net accumulated loss on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $124 million, \nwhich is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.\nFAIR VALUE HEDGES\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated \nin currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized \nin other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude changes in forward \npoints from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.\nNET INVESTMENT HEDGES\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our \ninvestment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized \nin AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude changes in forward points from the assessment of hedge \neffectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.\nOTHER DERIVATIVES\nOther derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward contracts that we use to hedge \nintercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of \na subsidiary. Gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs, are recognized in other income (expense), net, along \nwith the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities.

The results of operations and financial \nposition of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. \n For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, \n2019 and 2020, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $3.1 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, and \nthe liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. \nTotal noncontrolling interests (“NCI”), including redeemable noncontrolling interests (“RNCI”), in our consolidated subsidiaries increased \nfrom $1.2 billion to $3.9 billion from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, primarily due to external investments in Waymo. \nNCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any \nperiod presented and is included within other income (expense), net. \nWAYMO\nWaymo is an autonomous driving technology development company with a mission to make it safe and easy for people and things \nto get where they’re going. In the first half of 2020, Waymo completed an externally led investment round raising in total $3.2 billion, \nwhich includes investment from Alphabet. No gain or loss was recognized. The investments related to external parties were accounted \nfor as equity transactions and resulted in recognition of noncontrolling interests.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in some VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily \nearly stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources. \nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly \naffect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position \nof these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments as non-marketable equity \ninvestments or equity method investments. \nVIEs are generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. We have determined \nthat the single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure \nof these unconsolidated VIEs were not material as of December 31, 2019 and 2020.\n\n72\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nNote 6.

We have \nagreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual \nproperty infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an \nindemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with \nour officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the \nunique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have a limited history of prior indemnification \nclaims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, \ncash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us \ncould be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. \nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible. \nLegal Matters\nANTITRUST INVESTIGATIONS\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC’s Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints \nagainst us. \nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping \nsearch results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) \nfine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring \nshopping ads into compliance with the EC’s decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017.\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution agreements infringed \nEuropean competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination \nof the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision. On October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain \nof our Android distribution practices. We recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2018.\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AdSense for \nSearch partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) \nand directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners’ agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, \n2019, we appealed the EC decision. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n78\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated \nBalance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on competition matters by regulatory authorities \nin the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. For example, in August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands \nfrom the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and \ncertain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that \nGoogle violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. Separately, on December 16, 2020, a number of state \nAttorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against Google in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, \nalleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. We \nbelieve these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. The DOJ and state Attorneys General continue their \ninvestigations into certain aspects of our business. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the United States, \nand other regulators around the world.\nPATENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our \nproducts, services, and technologies infringe others’ intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards \nof substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, \nfunctionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products \nor technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International \nTrade Commission (“ITC”) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate \nloss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, \na prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products \ninto the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain intellectual \nproperty infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay \nsignificant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the \nuse of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and \nadversely affect our business.\nIn 2010, Oracle America, Inc. (“Oracle”) brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of California, alleging that \nGoogle’s Android operating system infringes Oracle’s copyrights related to certain Java application programming interfaces. After \ntrial, final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of Google on June 8, 2016, and the court decided post-trial motions in \nfavor of Google. Oracle appealed and on March 27, 2018, the appeals court reversed and remanded the case for a trial on damages. \nOn May 29, 2018, we filed a petition for a rehearing at the Federal Circuit, and on August 28, 2018, the Federal Circuit denied the \npetition. On January 24, 2019, we filed a petition to the Supreme Court of the United States to review this case. On April 29, 2019, \nthe Supreme Court requested the views of the Solicitor General regarding our petition. On September 27, 2019, the Solicitor General \nrecommended denying our petition, and we provided our response on October 16, 2019. On November 15, 2019, the Supreme Court \ngranted our petition and made a decision to review the case. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in our case on October 7, \n2020. If the Supreme Court does not rule in our favor, the case will be remanded to the district court for further determination of the \nremaining issues in the case, including damages, if any. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and are defending ourselves vigorously. \nGiven the nature of this case, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, arising from this matter.\nOTHER \nWe are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition, \nintellectual property, privacy, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our \nusers, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other \nmatters. Such claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and \npenalties, injunctive relief, ongoing auditing and monitoring obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our \nbusiness models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our \nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\n79\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nCertain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We record a liability \nwhen we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that \na loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate \ndevelopments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and \nrelated reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine \nboth likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.\nWith respect to our outstanding matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible \nloss will not, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results \nof operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nNON-INCOME TAXES\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter \nof non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and \nservices in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from \nexaminations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we \ndetermine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible \nloss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome \nmay be materially different from our expectations.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 14. \nNote 11. Stockholders’ Equity \nConvertible Preferred Stock\nOur Board of Directors has authorized 100 million shares of convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value, issuable in series. As of \nDecember 31, 2019 and 2020, no shares were issued or outstanding.\nClass A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C capital stock. The \nrights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Each share of Class \nA common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C \ncapital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any \ntime at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\nShare Repurchases\nIn July 2020, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $28.0 billion of its Class \nC capital stock. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other \ninvestment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. \nThe repurchase program does not have an expiration date. \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we repurchased and subsequently retired 15.3 million and 21.5 million shares \nof Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of $18.4 billion and $31.1 billion, respectively. \nNote 12. Net Income Per Share \nWe compute net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock using the two-class method. Basic \nnet income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income \nper share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding \nduring the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive \neffect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by \napplication of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes \nthe conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B common stock does not assume the \nconversion of those shares.\n\n80\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock and Class C \ncapital stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of \nincorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends \non our Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our \ncertificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock \nmust be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation \nprovides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our \nBoard of Directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights \nof the Class A and Class B common shares and Class C capital stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the \nliquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis. \nIn the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B \ncommon stock and Class C capital stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions \nin liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.\nThe following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock and \nClass C capital stock (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018\nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\nBasic net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$\n13,200\n$\n2,072\n$\n15,464\nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n298,548 \n46,864 \n349,728 \nBasic net income per share\n$\n44.22\n$\n44.22\n$\n44.22\nDiluted net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation\n$\n13,200\n$\n2,072\n$\n15,464\nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B\nto Class A shares\n2,072\n0\n0\nReallocation of undistributed earnings\n(146)\n(24)\n146\nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$\n15,126\n$\n2,048\n$\n15,610\nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in basic computation\n298,548 \n46,864 \n349,728 \nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities\nAdd:\nConversion of Class B to Class A common shares outstanding\n46,864 \n0 \n0 \nRestricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares\n689 \n0 \n7,456 \nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n346,101 \n46,864 \n357,184 \nDiluted net income per share\n$\n43.70\n$\n43.70\n$\n43.70\n\n81\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019\nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\nBasic net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$\n14,846\n$\n2,307\n$\n17,190\nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n299,402 \n46,527 \n346,667 \nBasic net income per share\n$\n49.59\n$\n49.59\n$\n49.59\nDiluted net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation\n$\n14,846\n$\n2,307\n$\n17,190\nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B\nto Class A shares\n2,307 \n0 \n0 \nReallocation of undistributed earnings\n(126)\n(20)\n126 \nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$\n17,027\n$\n2,287\n$\n17,316\nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in basic computation\n299,402 \n46,527 \n346,667 \nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities\nAdd:\nConversion of Class B to Class A common shares outstanding\n46,527 \n0 \n0 \nRestricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares\n413 \n0 \n5,547 \nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n346,342 \n46,527 \n352,214 \nDiluted net income per share\n$\n49.16\n$\n49.16\n$\n49.16\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020\nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\nBasic net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$\n17,733\n$\n2,732\n$\n19,804\nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n299,815 \n46,182 \n334,819 \nBasic net income per share\n$\n59.15\n$\n59.15\n$\n59.15\nDiluted net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation\n$\n17,733\n$\n2,732\n$\n19,804\nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B\nto Class A shares\n2,732 \n0 \n0 \nReallocation of undistributed earnings\n(180)\n(25)\n180 \nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$\n20,285\n$\n2,707\n$\n19,984\nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in basic computation\n299,815 \n46,182 \n334,819 \nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities\nAdd:\nConversion of Class B to Class A common shares outstanding\n46,182 \n0 \n0 \nRestricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares\n87 \n0 \n6,125 \nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n346,084\n46,182\n340,944\nDiluted net income per share\n$\n58.61\n$\n58.61 \n$\n58.61 \n\n82\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nNote 13.

The U.S. Tax Court issued the final decision on December 28, 2015.

As a result of the Ninth Circuit court decision, our cumulative \nnet tax benefit of $418 million related to previously shared stock-based compensation costs was reversed in the year ended \nDecember 31, 2019.\nIn 2020, there was an increase in valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets that are not likely to be realized relating to certain \nof our Other Bets.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for \nfinancial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax \nauthorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2018 tax returns. We have also received tax assessments in multiple \nforeign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend any and all such \nclaims as presented.\nThe tax years 2011 through 2019 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. \nThere are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision \nfor income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the \nexpected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the \noutcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not \nconsistent with management’s expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution \noccurs. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible \nthat our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months.\n\n86\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 8  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nNote 15.

Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, \nand hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\nz Google Cloud includes Google’s infrastructure and data analytics platforms, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise \ncustomers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services and Google \nWorkspace (formerly known as G Suite) collaboration tools.\nz Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from the Other Bets are \nderived primarily through the sale of internet services as well as licensing and R&D services. \nRevenues and certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering, and hardware costs \nand other operating expenses, are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and \nexpenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. The associated costs, \nincluding depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage or headcount.\nUnallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and legal, including fines \nand settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared research and development activities.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our \ndisclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nBased on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our \ndisclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance \nthat information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, \nsummarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated \nand communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely \ndecisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe rely extensively on information systems to manage our business and summarize and report operating results. In 2019, we began \na multi-year implementation of a new global ERP system, which will replace much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP \nsystem is designed to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management \nand provide timely information to our management team. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several \nyears. The initial phase, which included changes to our general ledger and consolidated financial reporting systems, was completed \nduring the third quarter of 2020. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during \nthe quarter ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control \nover financial reporting. However, as the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we will change our processes \nand procedures, which in turn, could result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting. As such changes occur, we will \nevaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nAs a result of COVID-19, our global workforce continued to operate primarily in a work from home environment for the quarter ended \nDecember 31, 2020. While pre-existing controls were not specifically designed to operate in our current work from home operating \nenvironment, we believe that our internal controls over financial reporting continue to be effective. We have continued to re-evaluate and \nrefine our financial reporting process to provide reasonable assurance that we could report our financial results accurately and timely.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule \n13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial \nreporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations \nof the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over \nfinancial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit and \nCompliance Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited \nby Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no \nmatter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, \nthe design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is \nrequired to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n\n89\nALPHABET INC. ● ANNUAL REPORT\nPART II\nITEM 9B  OTHER INFORMATION\n—\nITEM 9B.

We\ncontinue this work under the leadership of Sundar Pichai, who has served as CEO of Google since 2015 and as CEO\nof Alphabet since 2019.\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments,\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Other Bets\ninclude earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. We take a long-term view and\nmanage the portfolio of Other Bets with the discipline and rigor needed to deliver long-term returns. Alphabet's\nstructure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence.\nAccess and technology for everyone\nThe Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people and businesses large and\nsmall. Our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant\ntoday as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find\nanswers to a company that also helps people get things done.\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools\nthey need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Every year, there are trillions of searches on\nGoogle, and 15% of the searches we see every day are new. We continue to invest deeply in AI and other technologies\nto ensure the most helpful search experience possible. YouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and\nopportunities to learn something new. And Google Assistant offers the best way to get things done seamlessly across\ndifferent devices, providing intelligent help throughout a person's day, no matter where they are.\nWe are continually innovating and building new product features that will help our users, partners, customers, and\ncommunities. We have invested more than $100 billion in R&D over the last five years. In addition, with the onset of\n4\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nthe pandemic, we have focused in particular on features that help people in their daily lives and that support\nbusinesses working to serve their customers. For example, we have added live busyness trends in Google Maps that\nhelp users instantly spot when a neighborhood or part of town is near or at its busiest. We have also helped businesses\nnavigate uncertainty during an uneven economic recovery, and we have worked to address the complex challenge of\ndistributing critical information about COVID-19 vaccines to billions of people around the world. Importantly, we have\nmade authoritative content a key focus area across both Google Search and YouTube to help users find trusted public\nhealth information.\nOther Bets also remain focused on innovation through technology that can positively affect people's lives. For\ninstance, Waymo is working toward our goal of making transportation safer and easier for everyone and Verily is\ndeveloping tools and platforms to improve health outcomes.\nMoonshots\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This\nincrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not\nevolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome,\nbut those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser.\nWe continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term within each of our segments. As we said in the\noriginal founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as they are the key\nto our long-term success.\nThe power of AI\nAcross the company, investments in AI and machine learning are increasingly driving many of our latest\ninnovations and have enabled us to build products that are smarter and more helpful. For example, in May of 2021, we\nintroduced Multitask Unified Model — or MUM — which has the potential to transform how Google helps with complex\ntasks. MUM is trained across 75 different languages, which means that it can learn from sources written in one\nlanguage and help bring that information to people in another. It is also multimodal, so it understands information\nacross text and images and, in the future, can expand to more modalities like video and audio. We are currently\nexperimenting with MUM’s capabilities to make searching more natural and intuitive and even enable entirely new ways\nto search.\nDeepMind also made a significant AI-powered breakthrough, solving a 50-year-old protein folding challenge,\nwhich will help the world better understand one of life’s fundamental building blocks, and will enable researchers to\ntackle new and difficult problems, from fighting diseases to environmental sustainability. DeepMind has since shared its\nnew AlphaFold protein structure database, which doubled the number of high-accuracy human protein structures\navailable to researchers.\nGoogle\nFor reporting purposes, Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\nGoogle Services\nServing our users\nWe have always been a company committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of\npeople. Our product innovations have made our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in the\nworld. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Gmail, Google Drive,\nGoogle Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, each with broad and growing adoption by users\naround the world.\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than two decades ago.\nRather than the ten blue links in our early search results, users can now get direct answers to their questions using\ntheir computer, mobile device, or their own voice, making it quicker, easier and more natural to find what they are\nlooking for.\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery\nand creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. With the\ncontinued adoption of mobile, people are consuming more digital content by watching more videos, playing more\ngames, listening to more music, reading more books, and using more apps than ever before. Working with content\ncreators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to find great digital content.\nFueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and hardware. That is why we continue to\ninvest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as\n5\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nwell as growing our family of hardware devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make\npeople's lives easier by combining the best of our AI, software and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest\ngeneration of hardware products such as Pixel 5a 5G and Pixel 6 phones, the Fitbit Charge 5, Chromecast with Google\nTV, and the new Google Nest Cams and Nest Doorbell. Creating products that people rely on every day is a journey\nthat we are investing in for the long run.\nThe key to building helpful products for users is our commitment to privacy, security, and user choice. We protect\nuser privacy and security with products that are secure by default and private by design, and that keep users in control\nof their data. Our privacy-preserving technologies safeguard individual privacy and enhance data protection. As the\nInternet evolves, so does our approach to privacy and security. We continue to enhance our anti-malware features in\nChrome and drive improvements such as auto-delete controls that automatically delete web and app searches after 18\nmonths. And we continue to keep users and their passwords safe through advances like our built-in password\nmanager.\nHow we make money\nWe have built world-class advertising technologies for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital\nmarketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide\nrange of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads\nat the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies.\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears\non Google Search & other properties, YouTube and Google Network partners' properties (\"Google Network\nproperties\"). We continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of\nadvertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\n•\nPerformance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on, leading to direct\nengagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving\nmeasurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n•\nBrand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity for advertisers' products and services,\nthrough videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand\nadvertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing\ncampaigns.\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web.\nWe focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering\nout invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and\nvideos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\nWe continue to look to the future and are making long-term investments that we expect to grow revenues beyond\nadvertising, including revenues from Google Play, hardware, and YouTube non-advertising.\n•\nGoogle Play generates revenues from sales of apps and in-app purchases and digital content sold in the\nGoogle Play store.\n•\nHardware generates revenues from sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, Pixel\nphones, and other devices.\n•\nYouTube non-advertising generates revenues from YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions and\nother services.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle was a company built in the cloud. We continue to invest in infrastructure, security, data management,\nanalytics, and AI. We see significant opportunity in helping businesses utilize these strengths with features like data\nmigration, modern development environments, and machine learning tools to provide enterprise-ready cloud services,\nincluding Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. Google Cloud Platform enables developers to build, test, and\ndeploy applications on its highly scalable and reliable infrastructure. Google Workspace collaboration tools — which\ninclude apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet and more — are designed with real-time collaboration and\nmachine intelligence to help people work smarter. Because more and more of today’s digital experiences are being built\nin the cloud, Google Cloud products help businesses of all sizes take advantage of the latest technology advances to\noperate more efficiently.\n•\nGoogle Cloud Platform generates revenues from infrastructure, platform and other services.\n6\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n•\nGoogle Workspace generates revenues from cloud-based collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail,\nDocs, Drive, Calendar and Meet.\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract\nterms longer than a year.\nOther Bets\nAcross Alphabet, we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries.\nAlphabet’s investment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes emerging businesses at various stages of development,\nranging from those in the R&D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for\nthem to become thriving, successful businesses in the medium to long term. While these early-stage businesses\nnaturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important\nstrides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and\ninternet services.\nOther Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent\nmembers and outside investors. We are investing in the portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the\nfocus, scale, and pace of investments.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable\ncompetition in every aspect of our business, including from:\n•\nGeneral purpose search engines and information services, such as Baidu, Microsoft's Bing, Naver, Seznam,\nYahoo, and Yandex.\n•\nVertical search engines and e-commerce providers, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking's\nKayak (travel queries), Microsoft's LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will\nnavigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.\n•\nSocial networks offered by ByteDance, Meta, Snap, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social\nnetworks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n•\nOther online advertising platforms and networks, such as Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Meta, that compete\nfor advertisers that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.\n•\nOther forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television. Our advertisers\ntypically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n•\nCompanies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that\nhave developed proprietary platforms, such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n•\nDigital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n•\nProviders of enterprise cloud services, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce.\n•\nProviders of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&T, ByteDance, Disney, Hulu, Meta, and Netflix.\n•\nOther digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n•\nProviders of workspace connectivity and productivity products, such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Zoom.\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and\ntechnologies to the marketplace across our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends\non attracting and retaining:\n•\nusers, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of\nour advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n•\nadvertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their\nadvertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n•\ncontent providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners\ngenerate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n7\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nOngoing Commitment to Sustainability\nWe believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect our planet. Sustainability is one of our\ncore values at Google, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. We have been a leader on\nsustainability and climate change since Google’s founding over 20 years ago. These are some of our key achievements\nover the past two decades:\n•\nIn 2007, we became the first major company to be carbon neutral for our operations.\n•\nIn 2017, we became the first major company to match 100% of our annual electricity use with renewable\nenergy, which we have achieved for four consecutive years.\n•\nIn 2020, we issued $5.75 billion in sustainability bonds—the largest sustainability or green bond issuance by\nany company in history at the time. The net proceeds from the issuance are used to fund environmentally and\nsocially responsible projects in the following eight areas: energy efficiency, clean energy, green buildings, clean\ntransportation, circular economy and design, affordable housing, commitment to racial equity, and support for\nsmall businesses and COVID-19 crisis response. As of December 31, 2020, we have allocated $3.47 billion of\nthe net proceeds, as outlined in our Sustainability Bond Impact Report published in 2021.\n•\nAlso in 2020, we compensated for our legacy carbon footprint, making Google the first major company to be\ncarbon neutral for its entire operating history.\nOur sustainability strategy is focused on three key pillars: accelerating the transition to carbon-free energy and a\ncircular economy, empowering everyone with technology, and benefiting the people and places where we operate.\nTo accelerate the transition to a carbon-free economy, in 2020, we launched our third decade of climate action,\nand we are now working toward a new set of ambitious goals. By 2030, we aim to:\n•\nachieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain;\n•\nbecome the first major company to run on carbon-free energy 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a\nyear;\n•\nenable 5 gigawatts of new carbon-free energy through investments in our key manufacturing regions; and\n•\nhelp more than 500 cities and local governments reduce an aggregate of 1 gigaton of carbon emissions\nannually.\nTo accelerate the transition to a circular economy, we are working to maximize the reuse of finite resources across\nour operations, products, and supply chains and to enable others to do the same. We are also working to empower\neveryone with technology by committing to help 1 billion people make more sustainable choices by the end of 2022\nthrough our core products.\nTo benefit the people and places where we operate, we have set goals to replenish more water than we consume\nby 2030 and to support water security in communities where we operate. We will focus on three areas: enhancing our\nstewardship of water resources across Google office campuses and data centers; replenishing our water use and\nimproving watershed health and ecosystems in water-stressed communities; and sharing technology and tools that\nhelp everyone predict, prevent, and recover from water stress.\nWe remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainability, and we will continue to lead and encourage others to join\nus in improving the health of our planet. We are proud of what we have achieved so far, and we are energized to help\nmove the world closer to a more sustainable and carbon-free future for all.\nMore information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports, including\nGoogle’s Environmental Report and Alphabet’s 2021 Sustainability Bond Impact Report, which outlines the allocation of\nour net proceeds from our sustainability bonds. The contents of our sustainability reports are not incorporated by\nreference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC. For additional\ninformation about risks and uncertainties applicable to our commitments to attain certain sustainability goals, see Risk\nFactors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCulture and Workforce\nWe are a company of curious, talented, and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and\nencourage the iteration of ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society.\nOur people are critical for our continued success, so we work hard to create an environment where employees\ncan have fulfilling careers, and be happy, healthy, and productive. We offer industry-leading benefits and programs to\ntake care of the diverse needs of our employees and their families, including opportunities for career growth and\n8\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\ndevelopment, resources to support their financial health, and access to excellent healthcare choices. Our competitive\ncompensation programs help us to attract and retain top candidates, and we will continue to invest in recruiting talented\npeople to technical and non-technical roles, and rewarding them well. We provide a variety of high quality training and\nsupport to our managers to build and strengthen their capabilities-–ranging from courses for new managers, to learning\nresources that help them provide feedback and manage performance, to coaching and individual support.\nAt Alphabet, we are committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a\nworkforce that is representative of the users we serve. More information on Google’s approach to diversity can be\nfound in our annual diversity reports, available publicly at diversity.google. The contents of our diversity reports are not\nincorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the\nSEC.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Alphabet had 156,500 employees. We have work councils and statutory employee\nrepresentation obligations in certain countries, and we are committed to supporting protected labor rights, maintaining\nan open culture and listening to all employees. Supporting healthy and open dialogue is central to how we work, and\nwe communicate information about the company through multiple internal channels to our employees.\nWhen necessary, we contract with businesses around the world to provide specialized services where we do not\nhave appropriate in-house expertise or resources, often in fields that require specialized training like cafe operations,\ncontent moderation, customer support, and physical security. We also contract with temporary staffing agencies when\nwe need to cover short-term leaves, when we have spikes in business needs, or when we need to quickly incubate\nspecial projects. We choose our partners and staffing agencies carefully, and review their compliance with Google’s\nSupplier Code of Conduct. We continually make improvements to promote a respectful and positive working\nenvironment for everyone — employees, vendors, and temporary staff alike.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to numerous United States (U.S.) federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide\nvariety of subject matters. Like other companies in the technology industry, we face heightened scrutiny from both U.S.\nand foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and regulations. Many of these laws and regulations\nare evolving and their applicability and scope, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain.\nOur compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could, individually or in the aggregate,\nincrease our cost of doing business, make our products and services less useful, limit our ability to pursue certain\nbusiness models, cause us to change our business practices, affect our competitive position relative to our peers,\nand/or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Risk Factors in Item 1A,\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect in Part II, Item 7, and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our\nproprietary technology and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international\ntrademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights. We have also filed patent applications in the U.S. and\nforeign countries covering certain of our technology, and acquired patent assets to supplement our portfolio. We have\nlicensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our rights to other parties.

Many of our advertisers,\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value\n(such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective\nmonetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, as well\nas changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may in the future, affect\nthe advertising that we are able to provide, which could harm our business. In addition, technologies have been\ndeveloped that make customized ads more difficult or that block the display of ads altogether and some providers of\nonline services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party\ndigital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm\nour reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting\nand buying patterns. Adverse macroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for\nadvertising, resulting in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial\ncondition and operating results.\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are\nuseful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our\nbusiness and operating results.\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing\ntechnologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully,\nwe must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services,\nand technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a\nwider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in R&D, including through\nacquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services.\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international\ncompetitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer\noperating histories and well established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources\nin ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in R&D\nand in talent, aggressively initiating intellectual property claims (whether or not meritorious), and continuing to compete\naggressively for users, advertisers, customers, and content providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing\nlaws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny,\nthereby affording them competitive advantages. Our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products\nand services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before us.\nOur operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the needs of our users,\nadvertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. As technologies continue to develop, our competitors may\nbe able to offer experiences that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This may force\nus to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive. If our competitors are\nmore successful than we are in providing compelling products and services or in attracting and retaining users,\nadvertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers, our operating results could be harmed.\nOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and\ncould divert management attention and harm our financial condition and operating results.\n10\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The\ninvestments that we are making across Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets reflect our ongoing efforts to\ninnovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content\nproviders. Our investments in Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets span a wide range of industries beyond\nonline advertising. Such investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return\nof capital and, in pursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities. These endeavors may involve\nsignificant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of resources and management attention from current operations\nand, with respect to Other Bets, the use of alternative investment, governance, or compensation structures that may fail\nto adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones, home devices, and\nwearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption\nof technological advancements by competitors, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual\nimprovement in product price and performance characteristics, and price and feature sensitivity on the part of\nconsumers and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively.\nWithin Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services,\nincluding Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to\nsupport cloud computing services and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our salesforce. At the same time, our\ncompetitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models are competitive\nand evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives.\nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among\nothers. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors and our\nofferings may not be able to compete effectively or to operate at sufficient levels of profitability.\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI and machine learning, raise\nethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for\nour products and services. Because all of these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such\nstrategies and offerings will be successful and will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating\nmargin in the future.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing\ncompetition. Changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, and property\nmix and an increasing competition for advertising may also affect our advertising revenue growth rate. We may also\nexperience a decline in our revenue growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, if there is a decrease in the\nrate of adoption of our products, services, and technologies, or due to deceleration or decline in demand for devices\nused to access our services, among other factors.\nIn addition, we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of\nfactors, such as the continued expansion of our business into new fields, including products and services such as\nhardware, Google Cloud, and subscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may\nhave margins lower than those we generate from advertising. We may also experience downward pressure on our\noperating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increased costs for many aspects of our\nbusiness. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical\noperating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. For additional information, see Trends in Our\nBusiness and Financial Effect in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of\nour products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for\nus. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products,\nservices, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country\nin which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have\ntaken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for\nour innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have\nadequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the\npossibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or\nunenforceable.\n11\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and\nother sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting\nfrom these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word\n“Google” could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” Some courts have\nruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S.,\nmay reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in\nother people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete.\nAlso, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of\nour intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.\nOur business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our\nability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.\nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the\nbrands within Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch\nnew and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content\nproviders, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of\nfactors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and\nsecurity issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to respond\nappropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable\npractices by advertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our\nbrands.\nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance equity in our brands may harm our business, financial condition, and\noperating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide\nhigh-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of\nsettings.\nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our financial condition,\noperating results, and prospects.\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability\nto supply both our products and our internet-based services.\nWe rely on other companies to manufacture many of our finished products; to design certain of our components\nand parts; to participate in the distribution of our products and services; and to design, manufacture, or assemble\ncertain components and parts in our technical infrastructure. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not\nable to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we\nengage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in\nthe pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them.\nWe have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages and/or price increases that could\nnegatively affect our operations, driven by raw material, component or part availability, manufacturing capacity, labor\nshortages, industry allocations, logistics capacity, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, natural disasters or pandemics,\nthe effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality\neffects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), and significant changes\nin the financial or business condition of our suppliers. In addition, some of the components we use in our technical\ninfrastructure and products are available from only one or limited sources, and we may not be able to find replacement\nvendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. In addition, a significant supply interruption that\naffects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay product availability.\nWe may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and\nconditions. We may be liable for materials and products that are not consumed due to market acceptance,\ntechnological change, obsolescences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of\nour hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of our\nhardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing\ncosts or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and negatively affect\nour financial results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on\nvolume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply.\n12\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nOur products and services have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from design,\nmanufacturing, or operations. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other\nmanufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or\nservices are defective, it could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies,\nsuch as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security,\nenvironmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. Violations\nof law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key\nrelationships, and damage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property\ncould affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims.\nInterruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications\nsystems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our\nreputation, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, problems with the design or implementation\nof our new global enterprise resource planning system could harm our business and operations.\nThe availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing\noperation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage,\ninterference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, natural disasters or pandemics, the effects\nof climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and\npower shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, telecommunications\nfailures, computer viruses, ransomware attacks, computer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other\nattempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major\nearthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of\nvandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced by facility operators. Some\nof our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The\noccurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic, closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems affecting our data\ncenters could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical\nand complex and have contained in the past, and may contain in the future, errors or vulnerabilities, which could result\nin interruptions in or failure of our services or systems.\nIn addition, we rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize\noperating results. We are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new ERP system, which is designed to\naccurately maintain our financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management, and\nprovide timely information to our management team. As the phased implementation continues, we may experience\ndelays, increased costs, and other difficulties. Failure to successfully design and implement the ERP system as\nplanned could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Additionally, if we do not effectively\nimplement the ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting could be negatively affected.\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, our financial\ncondition, and operating results.\nOur international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow\ninternationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 54% of our consolidated revenues in 2021. In\naddition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the\nfollowing:\n•\nrestrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent\nus from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;\n•\nimport and export requirements, tariffs and other market access barriers that may prevent or impede us from\noffering products or providing services to a particular market, or that could limit our ability to source assemblies\nand finished products from a particular market, and may increase our operating costs;\n•\nlonger payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;\n•\nan evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to new\nregulatory costs and challenges (including the transfer of personal data between the EU and the United\nKingdom and new customer requirements), in addition to other adverse effects that we are unable to effectively\nanticipate;\n13\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n•\nanti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain\npayments to government officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties;\n•\nuncertainty regarding liability for services and content, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of\nlegal precedent; and\n•\ndifferent employee/employer relationships, existence of works councils and labor unions, and other challenges\ncaused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions.\nBecause we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars,\nwe have faced, and will continue to face, exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we\nhedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S.\ndollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Hedging programs are also inherently\nrisky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to our Industry\nPeople access the Internet through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the\nadvancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of\nour products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed.\nPeople access the Internet through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, mobile phones,\nsmartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables, automobiles, and\ntelevision-streaming devices. Our products and services may be less popular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer\nor distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not be\navailable or may only be available with limited functionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result.\nSome manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices. In addition, search queries are\nincreasingly being undertaken via voice-activated speakers, apps, social media or other platforms, which could harm\nour business. It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and services and\ndeveloping competitive new products and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating\nand supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices. Failing to attract and retain a substantial\nnumber of new device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users, or failing to develop products and\ntechnologies that work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults and ability to capture future business opportunities.\nData privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could damage our\nreputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from\nusing our products and services. Software bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks on our systems\ncould result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users’ and customers’\nability to use our products and services, harming our business operations and reputation.\nConcerns about, including the adequacy of, our practices with regard to the collection, use, governance,\ndisclosure, or security of personal information or other data-privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our\nreputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as expectations\nand regulations regarding privacy and data change.\nOur products and services involve the storage, handling, and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive\ninformation. Software bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, and security breaches\nexpose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information, which could result in litigation and other\npotential liability, including regulatory fines and penalties, as well as reputational harm. Additionally, our products\nincorporate highly technical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and\nare likely in the future to contain, undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. We have in the past discovered, and may\nin the future discover, some errors in our software code only after we have released the code. Systems and control\nfailures, security breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent disclosure of user data could\nresult in government and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation, brand, and business, and impair our ability to\nattract and retain users or customers. Such incidents have occurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the\nscale and nature of our products and services. While there is no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant\ndamage, we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of\nbugs, theft, misuse, and security vulnerabilities or breaches.\nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis.\nCyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods\nof time. We have seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide vulnerabilities, such as the Log4j vulnerability reported in\nDecember 2021, which could affect our or other parties’ systems. We expect to continue to experience such\n14\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nincidents or vulnerabilities in the future. Our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform may also increase\nthe risk of retaliatory attack. We may experience future security issues, whether due to employee error or malfeasance\nor system errors or vulnerabilities in our or other parties’ systems. While we may not determine some of these issues to\nbe material at the time they occur and may remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not\nultimately result in significant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries and enforcement\nactions, litigation, and negative publicity. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, disable or\ndegrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage systems change frequently and often are recognized only after\nbeing launched against a target, even taking all reasonable precautions, including those required by law, we have been\nunable in the past and may continue to be unable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement\nadequate preventative measures.\nFurther, if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data-\nsecurity practices or fail to comply with our terms and policies or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach,\nour users’ information may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. If an actual or perceived breach of our or our\nbusiness partners’ or service providers’ security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security\nmeasures would be harmed, we could lose users and customers, our trade secrets or those of our business partners\nmay be compromised, and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may\ninclude class-action litigation) and regulatory action, fines, and penalties. Any of the foregoing consequences could\nhave a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, and results of operations.\nWhile we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including\ndedicated worldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or\npandemic, may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to\nprevent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal,\nreputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nFor additional information, see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under ‘Risks Related\nto Laws and Regulations’ below.\nOur ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of\nour platforms and misuse of user data.\nIn addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety,\nsecurity, and review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties,\nincluding investigation and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services. As\na result of these efforts, we have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, incidents of unnecessary\naccess to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. However, we may not have discovered,\nand may in the future not discover, all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data limitations, including our\nlack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, or other factors, including factors\noutside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic, and we may learn of such incidents or activity via third\nparties. Such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our\nterms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper ad\npurchases, activities that threaten people’s safety on- or off-line, or instances of spamming, scraping, or spreading\ndisinformation. While we may not determine some of these incidents to be material at the time they occurred and we\nmay remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal, financial,\nand reputational harm, including government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity.\nWe may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such\nincidents. Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation\nand brands, require us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations and adversely\naffect our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and\nregulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management’s time and attention,\nand lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\nProblematic content on our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content\nfarms, and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could damage our\nreputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services.\nWe, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms, including\nsophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate\nrevenues, or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent. While we invest\nsignificantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and\n15\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\ninvalid traffic, we have been unable and may continue to be unable to adequately detect and prevent all such abuses or\npromote uniformly high-quality content.\nMany websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in\nsearch results than our search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have\naffected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading,\nor undesirable content. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam\nin most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their\nrankings. We continuously combat web spam in our search results, including through indexing technology that makes it\nharder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. We also continue to invest in and deploy proprietary\ntechnology to detect and prevent web spam on our platforms. We also face other challenges from low-quality and\nirrelevant content websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality\ncontent to help them improve their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to\ndetect and prevent abuse from low-quality websites. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including\nviolations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference, activities that threaten\nthe safety and/or well-being of our users on- or off-line, and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation.\nIf we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality\ncontent, it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our\nfinancial condition or operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory action, which could result in\nmonetary penalties and damages and divert management’s time and attention.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet\naccess providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and\nservices, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products\nrequire significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant\nmarket power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable\ncompanies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers\nhave taken, or have stated that they may take measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user\naccess to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our\nofferings, by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing our competitors\npreferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet\naccess providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. For\nexample, in 2018 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could permit\ninternet access providers to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services. In\naddition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or\nblockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, advertisers, and/or\ncontent providers, and impair our ability to attract new ones; damage our reputation; and increase costs, thereby\nnegatively affecting our business.\nRisks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies\nWe face increased regulatory scrutiny as well as changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and policies\ngoverning a wide range of topics that may negatively affect our business.\nWe and other companies in the technology industry face increased regulatory scrutiny, enforcement action, and\nother proceedings. For instance, the U.S. Department of Justice, joined by a number of state Attorneys General, filed\nan antitrust complaint against Google on October 20, 2020, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to\nSearch and Search advertising. Similarly, on December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust\ncomplaint against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S.\nantitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. Various other regulatory\nagencies in the U.S. and around the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection agencies, data\nprotection authorities, grand juries, inter-agency consultative groups, and a range of other governmental bodies have\nand continue to review and in some cases challenge our products and services and their compliance with laws and\nregulations around the world. We continue to cooperate with these investigations and defend litigation where\nappropriate. Various laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have in the past,\nand may in the future, result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing auditing and monitoring\nobligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral\nlitigation, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n16\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nChanges in international and local social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies\nhave in the past, and may in the future, increase our cost of doing business and limit our ability to pursue certain\nbusiness models, offer products or services in certain jurisdictions, or cause us to change our business practices. We\nhave in the past had to alter or stop offering certain products and services as a result of laws or regulations that made\nthem unfeasible, and new laws or regulations could result in our having to terminate, alter, or withdraw products and\nservices in the future. Additional costs of doing business, new limitations, or changes to our business model or\npractices could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are subject to regulations, laws, and policies that govern a wide range of topics, including those related to\nmatters beyond our core products and services. For instance, new regulations, laws, policies, and international accords\nrelating to environmental and social matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are\nbeing developed and formalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may entail specific, target-driven\nframeworks and/or disclosure requirements. We have implemented robust environmental and social programs, adopted\nreporting frameworks and principles, and announced a number of goals and initiatives, including those related to\nenvironmental sustainability and diversity. The implementation of these goals and initiatives may require considerable\ninvestments, and our goals, with all of their contingencies, dependencies, and in certain cases, reliance on third-party\nverification and/or performance, are complex and ambitious, and we cannot guarantee that we will achieve them.\nAdditionally, there can be no assurance that our current programs, reporting frameworks, and principles will be in\ncompliance with any new environmental and social laws and regulations that may be promulgated in the U.S. and\nelsewhere, and the costs of changing any of our current practices to comply with any new legal and regulatory\nrequirements in the U.S. and elsewhere may be substantial. Furthermore, industry and market practices may further\ndevelop to become even more robust than what is required under any new laws and regulations, and we may have to\nexpend significant efforts and resources to keep up with market trends and stay competitive among our peers.\nA variety of new and existing laws and/or interpretations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. New\nlaws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner inconsistent\nwith our practices, have made, and may continue to make, our products and services less useful, limit our ability to\npursue certain business models or offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions, require us to incur\nsubstantial costs, expose us to civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices. These laws and\nregulations are evolving and involve matters central to our business, including, among others:\n•\nLaws and regulations around the world focused on large technology platforms, including the Digital Markets Act\nin the European Union and proposed antitrust legislation on self-preferencing and mergers and acquisitions in\nthe U.S., which may limit certain business practices, and in some cases, create the risk of significant penalties.\n•\nPrivacy laws, such as the GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, Virginia CDPA, and ColoPA (as defined and discussed further\nbelow).\n•\nData protection laws passed by many states within the U.S. and by certain countries regarding notification to\ndata subjects and/or regulators when there is a security breach of personal data.\n•\nConsumer protection laws, including EU’s New Deal for Consumers, which could result in monetary penalties\nand create a range of new compliance obligations.\n•\nNew laws further restricting the collection, processing and/or sharing of advertising-related data. Copyright or\nsimilar laws around the world, including the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (EUCD) and\nEU member state transpositions. These and similar laws that have been adopted or proposed introduce new\nlicensing regimes that could affect our ability to operate. The EUCD and similar laws could also increase the\nliability of some content-sharing services with respect to content uploaded by their users. Some of these laws,\nas well as follow-on administrative or judicial actions, have also created or may create a new property right in\nnews publications that limits the ability of some online services to link to, interact with, or present such content.\nThey may also require individual or collective compensation negotiations with news agencies and publishers\nfor the use of such content, which may result in payment obligations that significantly exceed the value that\nsuch content provides to Google and its users, potentially harming our services, commercial operations, and\nbusiness results.\n•\nData localization laws, which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country be\nstored and/or processed within that country.\n17\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n•\nVarious U.S. and international laws that govern the distribution of certain materials to children and regulate the\nability of online services to collect information from minors, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection\nAct of 1998 and the United Kingdom’s Age-Appropriate Design Code.\n•\nVarious laws with regard to content moderation and removal, and related disclosure obligations, such as the\nNetwork Enforcement Act in Germany and the European Union's pending Digital Services Act, which may\naffect our businesses and operations and may subject us to significant fines if such laws are interpreted and\napplied in a manner inconsistent with our practices or when we may not proactively discover such content due\nto the scale of third-party content and the limitations of existing technologies. Other countries, including\nSingapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom, have implemented or are considering similar legislation\nimposing penalties for failure to remove certain types of content.\n•\nVarious legislative, litigation, and regulatory activity regarding our Google Play billing policies and business\nmodel, which could result in monetary penalties, damages and/or prohibition.\n•\nVarious legislative and regulatory activity requiring disclosure of information about the operation of our services\nand algorithms, which may make it easier for websites to artificially promote low-quality, deceptive, or harmful\ncontent on services like Google Search and YouTube, potentially harming the quality of our services.\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these laws, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain and could\nharm our business. For example:\n•\nWe rely on statutory safe harbors, as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the\nCommunications Decency Act in the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, against liability for various\nlinking, caching, and hosting activities. Any legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may\nadversely affect us. There are legislative proposals in both the U.S. and EU that could reduce our safe harbor\nprotection.\n•\nCourt decisions such as the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on May 13, 2014\non the ‘right to be forgotten,’ which allows individuals to demand that Google remove search results about them\nin certain instances, may limit the content we can show to our users and impose significant operational\nburdens.\nThe introduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies, our activities in certain jurisdictions, or\nother actions we take have subjected us, and will likely continue to subject us, to additional laws and regulations. Our\ninvestment in a variety of new fields, such as healthcare and payment services, has expanded, and will continue to\nexpand, the scope of regulations that apply to our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations\nare high and are likely to increase in the future. Any failure on our part to comply with laws and regulations can result in\nnegative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other\npenalties.\nWe are subject to claims, suits, government investigations, other proceedings, and consent decrees that\nmay harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are subject to claims, suits, government investigations, other proceedings, and consent decrees involving\ncompetition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, consumer protection, tax, labor and employment,\ncommercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using\nour platforms, and other matters. Due to our manufacturing and sale of an expanded suite of products and services,\nincluding hardware as well as Google Cloud offerings, we also are subject to a variety of claims including product\nwarranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation. We may\nalso be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental effects, or\nservice disruptions or failures.\nAny of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, diversion of\nmanagement resources, negative publicity and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a\ncomplex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. The resolution of one or more such proceedings has\nresulted in, and may in the future result in, additional substantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that\ncould harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content.\nOur products and services let users exchange information, advertise products and services, conduct business,\nand engage in various online activities. We also place advertisements displayed on other companies’ websites, and we\noffer third-party products, services, and/or content. The law relating to the liability of online service providers for others’\nactivities on their services is still somewhat unsettled around the world. Claims have been brought against us, and we\n18\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nexpect will continue to be brought against us, for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright and\ntrademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, torts, fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature\nand content of information available on or via our services.\nWe may be subject to claims by virtue of our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or\nproviding access to content created by third parties. Defense of such actions could be costly and involve significant\ntime and attention of our management and other resources, may result in monetary liabilities or penalties, and may\nrequire us to change our business in an adverse manner.\nPrivacy and data protection regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Any failure or alleged\nfailure to comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nAuthorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals\nconcerning data protection and limits on encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation have\nresulted in, and may continue to result in, fines and orders requiring that we change our data practices, which could\nhave an adverse effect on our ability to provide services, harming our business operations. Complying with these\nevolving laws could result in substantial costs and harm the quality of our products and services, negatively affecting\nour business, and may be particularly challenging during certain times, such as a natural disaster or pandemic.\nAmongst others, we are and will be subject to the following laws and regulations:\n•\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which applies to all of our activities conducted from an\nestablishment in the EU or related to products and services that we offer to EU users or customers, or the\nmonitoring of their behavior in the EU. Ensuring compliance with the range of obligations created by the GDPR\nis an ongoing commitment that involves substantial costs. Despite our efforts, governmental authorities or\nothers have asserted and may continue to assert that our business practices fail to comply with its\nrequirements. If our operations are found to violate the GDPR requirements, we may incur substantial fines,\nhave to change our business practices, and face reputational harm, any of which could have an adverse effect\non our business. Serious breaches of the GDPR can result in administrative fines of up to 4% of annual\nworldwide revenues. Fines of up to 2% of annual worldwide revenues can be levied for other specified\nviolations.\n•\nVarious state privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which came into\neffect in January of 2020; the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which will go into effect in 2023; the\nVirginia Consumer Data Protection Act (Virginia CDPA), which will go into effect in 2023; and the Colorado\nPrivacy Act (ColoPA), which will go into effect in 2023; all of which give new data privacy rights to their\nrespective residents (including, in California, a private right of action in the event of a data breach resulting\nfrom our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices) and impose\nsignificant obligations on controllers and processors of consumer data.\n•\nSB-327 in California, which regulates the security of data in connection with internet connected devices.\nFurther, we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances\nwe can transfer, process and/or receive personal data. The EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks that\npreviously allowed U.S. companies that self-certify to the U.S. Department of Commerce and publicly commit to comply\nwith specified requirements to import personal data from the EU and Switzerland have been invalidated by the CJEU.\nThe CJEU upheld Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) as a valid transfer mechanism, provided they meet certain\nrequirements. On June 4, 2021, the European Commission published new SCCs for this purpose, and we may have to\nadapt our existing contractual arrangements to meet these new requirements. The validity of data transfer mechanisms\nremains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments in both Europe and the U.S., such as recent\nrecommendations from the European Data Protection Board, decisions from supervisory authorities, recent proposals\nfor reform of the data transfer mechanisms for transfers of personal data outside the United Kingdom, and potential\ninvalidation of other data transfer mechanisms, which, together with increased enforcement action from supervisory\nauthorities in relation to cross-border transfers of personal data, could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to\nprocess and transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area and/or the United Kingdom.\nThese laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, including developments which create some\nuncertainty, and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or harm the operations of our products and\nservices in ways that harm our business. For example, in the EU, several supervisory authorities have issued new\nguidance concerning the ePrivacy Directive’s requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies,\nincluding limitations on the use of data across messaging products and specific requirements for enabling users to\naccept or reject cookies, and have in some cases brought (and may seek to bring in the future) enforcement action in\nrelation to those requirements. In the U.S., certain types of cookies may be deemed sales of personal information\n19\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nwithin the CCPA and other state laws, such that certain disclosure requirements and limitations apply to the use of such\ncookies. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection\nrequirements or requiring local storage and processing of data that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering\nour services and carries the potential of service interruptions in those countries.\nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend,\nresult in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to\nuse certain technologies in the future.\nWe, like other internet, technology and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations\nof infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent-holding companies may frequently\nseek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us. As we have grown, the\nnumber of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as we develop new\nproducts, services, and technologies.\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Other parties have\nalso sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts and the U.S. International\nTrade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell our products or\nservices in the U.S. or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe\nthe intellectual property subject to the claims. Adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary\ndamages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders preventing us from offering\ncertain features, functionalities, products, or services. They may also cause us to change our business practices and\nrequire development of non-infringing products, services, or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for\nus and otherwise harm our business.\nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property\ninfringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant\ndamages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the\nuse of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of\nrevenues and adversely affect our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers,\nwhen obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual\nproperty infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future\nagree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual property\nclaims. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or\nsettle. To the extent such claims are successful, they may harm our business, including our product and service\nofferings, financial condition, or operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-\nterm stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could\ndiminish our cash reserves.\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with\nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and\ndoes not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares.\nFurther, our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves\nand may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has\nno voting rights. As of December 31, 2021, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 85.9% of our\noutstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 51.4% of the voting power of our outstanding common\nstock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder\napproval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our\ncompany or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no voting rights\n(except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based acquisition\ntransactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey’s current relative voting\npower and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of\nour stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also\n20\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\naffect Larry and Sergey’s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’\nability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial,\nwhich could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that\nstockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a\nchange of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n•\nOur certificate of incorporation provides for a tri-class capital stock structure. As a result of this structure, Larry\nand Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval. This concentrated control\ncould discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transaction\nthat other stockholders may view as beneficial.\n•\nOur Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of\nDirectors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director.\n•\nOur stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding\na stockholders' meeting.\n•\nOur certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of\nminority stockholders to elect director candidates.\n•\nStockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to\npropose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter\na potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or\notherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\n•\nOur Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which\nmakes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences\nthat could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law,\na corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock\nunless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the\ntransaction. Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\nGeneral Risks\nThe continuing effects of COVID-19 are highly unpredictable and could be significant, and may have an\nadverse effect on our business, operations and our future financial performance.\nSince COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, our business, operations and\nfinancial performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by the macroeconomic impacts resulting from the\nefforts to control the spread of COVID-19. As a result of the scale of the ongoing pandemic, including the introduction of\nnew variants of COVID-19 and vaccination and other efforts to control the spread, our revenue growth rate and\nexpenses as a percentage of our revenues in future periods may differ significantly from our historical rates, and our\nfuture operating results may fall below expectations. Additionally, we may experience a significant and prolonged shift\nin user behavior such as a shift in interests to less commercial topics.\nAs a result of the pandemic, our workforce shifted to operating in a primarily remote working environment, which\ncontinues to create inherent productivity, connectivity, and oversight challenges. The effects of the ongoing pandemic\nare dynamic and uneven. As we prepare to return our workforce in more locations back to the office, we may\nexperience increased costs and/or disruption as we experiment with hybrid work models, in addition to potential effects\non our ability to operate effectively and maintain our corporate culture.\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our\nresults to fall short of expectations.\nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future fluctuate, as a result of a number of factors, many\noutside of our control, including the cyclicality and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events. As a result,\ncomparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis\nmay not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance.\nConsequently, our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations.\n21\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution,\nand other consequences that may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy\nand use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect\nto continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic transactions, which\ncould create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include:\n•\ndiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and\nother strategic transactions;\n•\nfailure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions\nplaced upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or\notherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction;\n•\nfailure to successfully integrate and further develop the acquired business or technology;\n•\nimplementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company;\n•\nintegration of the acquired company’s accounting, human resource (including cultural integration and retention\nof employees), and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering, and sales and\nmarketing functions;\n•\ntransition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;\n•\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and\nto address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n•\nliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark\ninfringement claims, data privacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities,\nwarranty claims, product liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n•\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees,\ncustomers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions\nand other strategic transactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated liabilities,\nand harm our business generally.\nOur acquisitions and other strategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the\nincurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-\nlived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition or operating results. Also, the\nanticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not materialize. In connection with\nour divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities,\nwhich may harm our financial condition or operating results.\nIf we were to lose the services of key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management\nteam. For instance, Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of Alphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an\nimportant role in the development of our technology, maintaining our culture, and setting our strategic direction. All of\nour executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance\npolicies. The loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified\npersonnel, or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our ability to compete\neffectively and our future success depends on our continuing to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly\nskilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and\ncertain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as\nour equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating\nour existing employees. Restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes may also affect our ability to hire,\nmobilize, or retain some of our global talent.\n22\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization\ngrows and evolves, we may need to implement more complex organizational management structures or adapt our\ncorporate culture and work environments to ever-changing circumstances, such as during times of a natural disaster or\npandemic, and these changes could affect our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate\nculture.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial\nstatements incorporate valuation methodologies that are subjective in nature resulting in fluctuations over\ntime.\nThe fair value of our investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the past, negatively\naffected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying entities, foreign\nexchange rates, changes in interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation of new\nbenchmark rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors.\nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-\nbased compensation awards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a\nbusiness combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The determination of fair value involves use of appropriate\nvaluation methods and certain unobservable inputs, requires management judgment and estimation, and may change\nover time. We adjust the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities to fair value for observable transactions\nof identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairments. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity\nsecurities, are recognized in other income (expense), which increases the volatility of our other income (expense). The\nunrealized gains and losses we record from fair value remeasurements of our non-marketable equity securities in any\nparticular period may differ significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately experience on such investments.\nAs a result of these factors, the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents, as well as our marketable and non-\nmarketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment, which could adversely affect our financial\ncondition and operating results.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\nOur future income taxes could be negatively affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that\nhave lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, the net\ngains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other\ntransactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, decreases in our stock price for shares paid as\nemployee compensation, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, the application of different\nprovisions of tax laws or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the\ninterpretation of existing laws), as well as certain discrete items.\nIn addition, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we\nhave received, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including in Europe, on various tax-\nrelated assertions, such as transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of\nsuch a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition and could require us\nto change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. It may also subject us to additional litigation and\nregulatory inquiries, resulting in the diversion of management’s time and attention. In addition, the determination of our\nworldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many\ntransactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates\nare reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may\naffect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions\nmay be subject to significant changes in ways that impair our financial results. Various jurisdictions around the world\nhave enacted or are considering digital services taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping\ninternational tax regimes. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) continues to advance\nproposals relating to its initiative for modernizing international tax rules, with the goal of having different countries\nimplement a modernized and aligned international tax framework, but there can be no guarantee that this will occur.\nIn addition, in response to significant market volatility and disruptions to business operations resulting from the\nglobal spread of COVID-19, legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may propose\nchanges to their tax rules. These changes could include modifications that have temporary effect, and more permanent\n23\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nchanges. The effect of these potential new rules on us, our long-term tax planning, and our effective tax rate could be\nmaterial.\nThe trading price for our Class A stock and non-voting Class C stock may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile.\nIn addition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading price of our Class A stock and Class C stock have\nfluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control,\nincluding, among others, the activities of our peers and changes in broader economic and political conditions around\nthe world. These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C\nstock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nITEM 1B.\nUNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES\nOur headquarters are located in Mountain View, California.

Our Class A common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol\n“GOOG” since August 19, 2004 and under the symbol \"GOOGL\" since April 3, 2014. Prior to August 19, 2004, there\nwas no public market for our stock. Our Class B common stock is neither listed nor traded. Our Class C capital stock\nhas been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG” since April 3, 2014.\nHolders of Record\nAs of December  31, 2021, there were approximately 4,907 and 1,733 stockholders of record of our Class A\ncommon stock and Class C capital stock, respectively. Because many of our shares of Class A common stock and\nClass C capital stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the\ntotal number of stockholders represented by these record holders.

We report Google in two segments,\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Other Bets\ninclude earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. For further details on our\nsegments, see Part I, Item 1 “Business” and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in\nItem 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate\nthat they will continue to affect our future results:\n•\nUsers' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\nThe continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since inception,\ncontributing to revenue growth, and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business.\n•\nUsers are increasingly using diverse devices and modalities to access our products and services, and\nour advertising revenues are increasingly coming from new formats.\nOur users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables and\nsmart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are\nfocused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our\nbusiness.\nWe are increasingly generating advertising revenues from different channels, including mobile, and newer\nadvertising formats. The margins on advertising revenues from these channels and newer products have generally\nbeen lower than those from traditional desktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or\nmodality matures, our revenues may be affected. For example, growth in the global smartphone market has slowed\ndue to various factors, including increased market saturation in developed countries, which can affect our mobile\nadvertising revenue growth rates.\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow\nand TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic\nmix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product\nmix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenue growth rates and put pressure on our margins.\n•\nAs online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our\nmonetization.\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to\nexpand and evolve our product offerings to serve these changing needs. Over time, we expect our monetization trends\nto fluctuate. For example, we have seen an increase in revenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play, which\nmonetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads.\n•\nAs users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets\ncontinue to increase and movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues.\nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S.,\nincluding in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our\nproducts and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased\nrevenues from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these\nmarkets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as\ndeveloping markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\n28\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program\ndesigned to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues\nand earnings.\n•\nThe portion of revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may adversely\naffect margins.\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our\nofferings through products and services like Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware products, and YouTube\nsubscriptions. We currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps and in-app purchases, digital\ncontent products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud services and\nsubscription and other services. A number of Other Bets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such,\nrevenues from these businesses could be volatile. In addition, the margins on these revenues vary significantly and\nmay be lower than the margins on our advertising revenues.\n•\nAs we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and\ncapital expenditures.\nWe continue to make significant R&D investments in areas of strategic focus across Google Services, Google\nCloud and Other Bets. We also expect to continue to invest in land and buildings for data centers and offices, and\ninformation technology assets, which includes servers and network equipment, to support the long-term growth of our\nbusiness. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings,\nexpand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic\ninitiatives. For example, in January 2021 we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, Inc. for $2.1 billion, which is expected to\nhelp spur innovation in wearable devices.\n•\nWe face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our\nbusiness practices and financial results.\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide\nrange of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As\nthese global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, and our ability to pursue certain business\nmodels or offer certain products or services may be limited. Examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General, the Digital Markets Act in Europe, and various\nlegislative proposals in the U.S. focused on large technology platforms.\n•\nOur employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring\ntalented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional information\nsee Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 “Business.”\nSeasonality and other\nOur advertising revenues are affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and\nunderlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality. Additionally, our non-advertising revenues, including\nthose generated from Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware, and YouTube, may be affected by fluctuations driven by\nchanges in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches, other market dynamics,\nas well as seasonality.\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\nGoogle Services\nGoogle Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising (“Google advertising”) as well as\nrevenues from other sources (“Google other revenues”).\nGoogle Advertising\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\n•\nGoogle Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues\nfrom traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers,\ntoolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n•\nYouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\n29\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n•\nGoogle Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob,\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nWe use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our\nadvertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while\nimpressions and cost-per-impressions pertain to traffic on our Network partners’ properties.\nPaid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search\nproperties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play. Cost-per-\nclick is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount\nwe charge advertisers for each engagement by users.\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in\nAdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based\nrevenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for\neach impression displayed to users.\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering,\nand counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by\nthe corresponding click and impression activity.\nOur advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search & other\nproperties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation\nbetween these items, have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors, including:\n•\nadvertiser competition for keywords;\n•\nchanges in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;\n•\nchanges in device mix;\n•\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n•\nfees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;\n•\ngeneral economic conditions, including the effect of COVID-19;\n•\nseasonality; and\n•\ntraffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals\nand channels.\nGoogle Other\nGoogle other revenues are comprised of the following:\n•\nGoogle Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play\nstore;\n•\nDevices and Services, which includes sales of hardware, including Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home\nproducts, and Pixel phones;\n•\nYouTube non-advertising, which includes YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions; and\n•\nother products and services.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:\n•\nGoogle Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;\n•\nGoogle Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail,\nDocs, Drive, Calendar and Meet; and\n•\nother enterprise services.\nOther Bets\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n30\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nFor further details on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses\ninclude costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of these\nexpenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our\noperating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenue.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n•\nTAC includes:\n◦\nAmounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services.\nOur distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers,\nand software developers.\n◦\nAmounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n•\nOther cost of revenues includes:\n◦\nContent acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and\nother content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers\nbased on revenues generated or a flat fee).\n◦\nExpenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses,\ndepreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content\nreview as well as customer and product support costs).\n◦\nInventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell.\nThe cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are\nsignificantly higher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google\nSearch & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are\npaid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either\nR&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.\nThe main components of our R&D expenses are:\n•\ncompensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing\nand new products and services;\n•\ndepreciation; and\n•\nprofessional services fees primarily related to consulting and outsourcing services.\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\n•\ncompensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer\nservice functions; and\n•\nspending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\n•\ncompensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other\nadministrative support functions;\n•\nexpenses related to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and\n•\nprofessional services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and outsourcing services.\n31\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency\nexchange gains (losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities,\nperformance fees, and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.\nFor additional details, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in the\nvalue of our investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II,\nItem 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market\nRisk”.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred in\nthe U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision includes the effect of reserve provisions and\nchanges to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.\nFor additional details, including a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate, see Note\n14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nExecutive Overview\nThe following table summarizes consolidated financial results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021\nunless otherwise specified (in millions, except for per share information and percentages):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020\n2021\n$ Change\n% Change\nConsolidated revenues\n$\n182,527 \n$\n257,637 \n$\n75,110 \n41 %\nChange in consolidated constant currency revenues\n39 %\nCost of revenues\n$\n84,732 \n$\n110,939 \n$\n26,207 \n31 %\nOperating expenses\n$\n56,571 \n$\n67,984 \n$\n11,413 \n20 %\nOperating income\n$\n41,224 \n$\n78,714 \n$\n37,490 \n91 %\nOperating margin\n23 %\n31 %\n8 %\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n6,858 \n$\n12,020 \n$\n5,162 \n75 %\nNet Income\n$\n40,269 \n$\n76,033 \n$\n35,764 \n89 %\nDiluted EPS\n$\n58.61 \n$\n112.20 \n$\n53.59 \n91 %\nNumber of Employees\n135,301\n156,500\n21,199\n16 %\n•\nRevenues were $257.6 billion, an increase of 41%. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by Google\nServices and Google Cloud. The adverse effect of COVID-19 on 2020 advertising revenues also contributed to\nthe year-over-year growth.\n•\nCost of revenues was $110.9 billion, an increase of 31%, primarily driven by increases in TAC and content\nacquisition costs. An overall increase in data centers and other operations costs was partially offset by a\nreduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain\nnetwork equipment.\n•\nOperating expenses were $68.0 billion, an increase of 20%, primarily driven by headcount growth, increases in\nadvertising and promotional expenses and charges related to legal matters.\nOther information:\n•\nOperating cash flow was $91.7 billion, primarily driven by revenues generated from our advertising products.\n•\nShare repurchases were $50.3 billion, an increase of 62%. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\n32\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n•\nCapital expenditures, which primarily reflected investments in technical infrastructure, were $24.6 billion.\n•\nIn January 2021, we updated the useful lives of certain of our servers and network equipment, resulting in a\nreduction in depreciation expense of $2.6 billion recorded primarily in cost of revenues and R&D. See Note 1 of\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nfurther information.\n•\nOur acquisition of Fitbit closed in early January 2021, and the related revenues are included in Google other.\nSee Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for further information.\n•\nOn February 1, 2022, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-\nfor-one stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the Company’s Class A,\nClass B, and Class C stock. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nThe Effect of COVID-19 on our Financial Results\nWe began to observe the effect of COVID-19 on our financial results in March 2020 when, despite an increase in\nusers' search activity, our advertising revenues declined compared to the prior year. This was due to a shift of user\nsearch activity to less commercial topics and reduced spending by our advertisers. For the quarter ended June 30,\n2020 our advertising revenues declined due to the continued effects of COVID-19 and the related reductions in global\neconomic activity, but we observed a gradual return in user search activity to more commercial topics. This was\nfollowed by increased spending by our advertisers, which continued throughout the second half of 2020. Additionally,\nover the course of 2020, we experienced variability in our margins as many of our expenses are less variable in nature\nand/or may not correlate to changes in revenues. Market volatility contributed to fluctuations in the valuation of our\nequity investments. Further, our assessment of the credit deterioration of our customers due to changes in the\nmacroeconomic environment during the period was reflected in our allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable.\nThroughout 2021 we remained focused on innovating and investing in the services we offer to consumers and\nbusinesses to support our long-term growth. The impact of COVID-19 on 2020 financial results affected year-over-year\ngrowth trends. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, be unpredictable and affect our business and financial\nresults. Our past results may not be indicative of our future performance, and historical trends in our financial results\nmay differ materially.\nFinancial Results\nRevenues\nThe following table presents revenues by type (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020\n2021\nGoogle Search & other\n$\n104,062  $\n148,951 \nYouTube ads\n19,772 \n28,845 \nGoogle Network\n23,090 \n31,701 \nGoogle advertising\n146,924 \n209,497 \nGoogle other\n21,711 \n28,032 \nGoogle Services total\n168,635 \n237,529 \nGoogle Cloud\n13,059 \n19,206 \nOther Bets\n657 \n753 \nHedging gains (losses)\n176 \n149 \nTotal revenues\n$\n182,527  $\n257,637 \nGoogle Services\nGoogle advertising revenues\nGoogle Search & other\nGoogle Search & other revenues increased $44.9 billion from 2020 to 2021. The overall growth was driven by\ninterrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage, primarily\n33\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\non mobile devices, growth in advertiser spending, and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery. The\nadverse effect of COVID-19 on 2020 revenues also contributed to the year-over-year increase.\nYouTube ads\nYouTube ads revenues increased $9.1 billion from 2020 to 2021. Growth was driven by our direct response and\nbrand advertising products. Growth for our direct response advertising products was primarily driven by increased\nadvertiser spending as well as improvements to ad formats and delivery. Growth for our brand advertising products was\nprimarily driven by increased spending by our advertisers and the adverse effect of COVID-19 on 2020 revenues.\nGoogle Network\nGoogle Network revenues increased $8.6 billion from 2020 to 2021. The growth was primarily driven by strength\nin AdMob, Google Ad Manager, and AdSense. The adverse effect of COVID-19 on 2020 revenues also contributed to\nthe year-over-year increase.\nMonetization Metrics\nPaid clicks and cost-per-click\nThe following table presents changes in paid clicks and cost-per-click (expressed as a percentage) from 2020 to\n2021:\n \nYear Ended December\n31,\n \n2021\nPaid clicks change\n23 %\nCost-per-click change\n15 %\nPaid clicks increased from 2020 to 2021 driven by a number of interrelated factors, including an increase in search\nqueries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices; an increase in clicks relating to\nads on Google Play; growth in advertiser spending; and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery. The\nadverse effect of COVID-19 on 2020 paid clicks also contributed to the increase.\nThe increase in cost-per-click from 2020 to 2021 was driven by a number of interrelated factors including changes\nin device mix, geographic mix, growth in advertiser spending, ongoing product changes, and property mix, as well as\nthe adverse effect of COVID-19 in 2020.\nImpressions and cost-per-impression\nThe following table presents changes in impressions and cost-per-impression (expressed as a percentage) from\n2020 to 2021:\n \nYear Ended December\n31,\n \n2021\nImpressions change\n2 %\nCost-per-impression change\n35 %\nImpressions increased from 2020 to 2021 primarily driven by growth in AdMob, partially offset by a decline in\nimpressions related to AdSense. The increase in cost-per-impression was primarily driven by the adverse effect of\nCOVID-19 in 2020 as well as the effect of interrelated factors including ongoing product and policy changes and\nimprovements we have made in ad formats and delivery, changes in device mix, geographic mix, product mix, and\nproperty mix.\nGoogle other revenues\nGoogle other revenues increased $6.3 billion from 2020 to 2021. The growth was primarily driven by YouTube\nnon-advertising and hardware, followed by Google Play. Growth for YouTube non-advertising was primarily due to an\nincrease in paid subscribers. Growth in hardware reflects the inclusion of Fitbit revenues, as the acquisition closed in\nJanuary 2021, and an increase in phone sales. Growth for Google Play was primarily driven by sales of apps and in-\napp purchases.\n34\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle Cloud revenues increased $6.1 billion from 2020 to 2021. The growth was primarily driven by GCP\nfollowed by Google Workspace offerings. Google Cloud's infrastructure and platform services were the largest drivers\nof growth in GCP.\nRevenues by Geography\nThe following table presents revenues by geography as a percentage of revenues, determined based on the\naddresses of our customers:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2020\n2021\nUnited States\n47 %\n46 %\nEMEA\n30 %\n31 %\nAPAC\n18 %\n18 %\nOther Americas\n5 %\n5 %\nFor further details on revenues by geography, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUse of Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Percentage Change\nThe effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period\ncomparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency\nrevenues for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We\nbelieve the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting\nPrinciples (GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because it excludes the effects of\nforeign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange\nrate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a\nyear-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year\ncomparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated\nusing prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures\nused by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\n35\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nThe following table presents the foreign exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues (in millions,\nexcept percentages):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n2020\n2021\n% Change from Prior\nYear\nEMEA revenues\n$\n55,370  $\n79,107 \n43 %\nEMEA constant currency revenues\n76,321 \n38 %\nAPAC revenues\n32,550 \n46,123 \n42 %\nAPAC constant currency revenues\n45,666 \n40 %\nOther Americas revenues\n9,417 \n14,404 \n53 %\nOther Americas constant currency revenues\n14,317 \n52 %\nUnited States revenues\n85,014 \n117,854 \n39 %\nHedging gains (losses)\n176 \n149 \nTotal revenues\n$\n182,527  $\n257,637 \n41 %\nRevenues, excluding hedging effect\n$\n182,351  $\n257,488 \nExchange rate effect\n(3,330)\nTotal constant currency revenues\n$\n254,158 \n39 %\nEMEA revenue growth from 2020 to 2021 was favorably affected by foreign currency exchange rates, primarily\ndue to the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Euro and British pound.\nAPAC revenue growth from 2020 to 2021 was favorably affected by foreign currency exchange rates, primarily\ndue to the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Australian dollar, partially offset by the U.S. dollar strengthening relative\nto the Japanese yen.\nOther Americas growth change from 2020 to 2021 was favorably affected by changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the Canadian dollar, partially offset by the U.S.\ndollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso and the Brazilian real.\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of Revenues\nThe following tables present cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, except percentages):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2020\n2021\nTAC\n$\n32,778 \n$\n45,566 \nOther cost of revenues\n51,954 \n65,373 \nTotal cost of revenues\n$\n84,732 \n$\n110,939 \nTotal cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues\n46.4 %\n43.1 %\nCost of revenues increased $26.2 billion from 2020 to 2021. The increase was due to an increase in other cost of\nrevenues and TAC of $13.4 billion and $12.8 billion, respectively.\nThe increase in TAC from 2020 to 2021 was due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners and to Google\nNetwork partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 22.3% to 21.8%\nfrom 2020 to 2021 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other\nproperties. The TAC rate on Google Search & other properties revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network\nrevenues were both substantially consistent from 2020 to 2021.\nThe increase in other cost of revenues from 2020 to 2021 was driven by increases in content acquisition costs\nprimarily for YouTube, data center and other operations costs, and hardware costs. The increase in data center and\n36\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nother operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated\nuseful life of our servers and certain network equipment beginning in the first quarter of 2021.\nResearch and Development\nThe following table presents R&D expenses (in millions, except percentages):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2020\n2021\nResearch and development expenses\n$\n27,573 \n$\n31,562 \nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of revenues\n15.1 %\n12.3 %\nR&D expenses increased $4.0 billion from 2020 to 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in\ncompensation expenses of $3.5 billion, largely resulting from an 11% increase in headcount, and an increase in\nprofessional service fees of $516 million. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense of\n$450 million including the effect of our change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment.\nSales and Marketing\nThe following table presents sales and marketing expenses (in millions, except percentages):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2020\n2021\nSales and marketing expenses\n$\n17,946 \n$\n22,912 \nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues\n9.8 %\n8.9 %\nSales and marketing expenses increased $5.0 billion from 2020 to 2021, primarily driven by an increase in\nadvertising and promotional activities of $2.5 billion and an increase in compensation expenses of $2.2 billion. The\nincrease in advertising and promotional activities was driven by both increased spending in the current period and a\nreduction in spending in 2020 due to COVID-19. The increase in compensation expenses was largely due to a 14%\nincrease in headcount.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe following table presents general and administrative expenses (in millions, except percentages):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2020\n2021\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n$\n11,052 \n$\n13,510 \nGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues\n6.1 %\n5.2 %\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $2.5 billion from 2020 to 2021. The increase was primarily driven\nby a $1.7 billion increase in charges relating to legal matters and a $664 million increase in compensation expenses,\nlargely resulting from a 14% increase in headcount. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in expense of\n$808 million related to a decline in allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, as 2020 reflected a higher\nallowance related to the economic effect of COVID-19.\n37\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nSegment Profitability\nThe following table presents segment operating income (loss) (in millions).\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020\n2021\nOperating income (loss):\nGoogle Services\n$\n54,606  $\n91,855 \nGoogle Cloud\n(5,607)\n(3,099)\nOther Bets\n(4,476)\n(5,281)\nCorporate costs, unallocated\n(3,299)\n(4,761)\nTotal income from operations\n$\n41,224  $\n78,714 \nUnallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and legal, including\ncertain fines and settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared R&D activities. Additionally, hedging gains\n(losses) related to revenue are included in corporate costs.\nGoogle Services\nGoogle services operating income increased $37.2 billion from 2020 to 2021. The increase was due to growth in\nrevenues partially offset by increases in TAC, content acquisition costs, compensation expenses, advertising and\npromotional expenses, and charges related to certain legal matters. The increase in expenses was partially offset by a\nreduction in costs driven by the change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment. The\neffect of COVID-19 on 2020 results affected the year-over-year increase in operating income.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle Cloud operating loss decreased $2.5 billion from 2020 to 2021. The decrease in operating loss was\nprimarily driven by growth in revenues, partially offset by an increase in expenses, primarily driven by compensation\nexpenses. The increase in expenses was partially offset by a reduction in costs driven by the change in the estimated\nuseful life of our servers and certain network equipment.\nOther Bets\nOther Bets operating loss increased $805 million from 2020 to 2021. The increase in operating loss was primarily\ndriven by increases in compensation expenses, including an increase in valuation-based compensation charges during\nthe second quarter of 2021.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents other income (expense), net, (in millions):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2020\n2021\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n6,858  $\n12,020 \nOther income (expense), net, increased $5.2 billion from 2020 to 2021.

Our effective tax rate\n(1)\n(1)\n38\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nwas substantially consistent from 2020 to 2021. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nFinancial Condition\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $139.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities.\nCash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid\ngovernment bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity\nsecurities.\nSources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow\nthat we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the\nbusiness. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace and form of capital return to\nstockholders.\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2020\n2021\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n65,124  $\n91,652 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(32,773) $\n(35,523)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n$\n(24,408) $\n(61,362)\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search & other\nproperties, Google Network properties, and YouTube ads. Additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps and in-\napp purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees including fees received for\nGoogle Cloud offerings and subscription-based products.\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network partners,\nfor compensation and related costs, and for content acquisition costs. In addition, uses of cash from operating activities\ninclude hardware inventory costs, income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to the net effect of an\nincrease in cash received from revenues and cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses, and changes in\noperating assets and liabilities.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of our investments in marketable\nand non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and non-\nmarketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to a decrease in maturities and\nsales of marketable securities, an increase in purchases of property and equipment, offset by a decrease in purchases\nof non-marketable securities.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the\nsale of interest in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of common\nand capital stock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to repayment of debt and an\nincrease in cash payments for repurchases of common and capital stock.\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and\nfinancing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and\nfinancing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\n39\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\nWe make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets\nthrough purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our\nservices and products.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\n•\ntechnical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing,\nstorage and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including machine learning (collectively\nreferred to as our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and\n•\noffice facilities, ground up development projects and related building improvements.\nConstruction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been\nplaced in service for our intended use. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets\nmay extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects\nwith multiple phases, where we acquire qualified land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install\ninformation technology assets.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, we spent $22.3 billion and $24.6 billion on capital\nexpenditures, respectively. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such\nassets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For the years ended December 31,\n2020 and 2021, our depreciation and impairment expenses on property and equipment were $12.9 billion and $11.6\nbillion, respectively.\nLeases\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, we recognized total operating lease assets of $2.8 billion and\n$3.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases,\nwhich had a weighted average remaining lease term of 8 years, was $15.5 billion, of which $2.5 billion is short-term. As\nof December 31, 2021, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future short-term and long-term\nlease payments of $606 million and $5.2 billion, excluding purchase options, that are not yet recorded on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2022 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms\nof 1 to 25 years.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs)\nwere $2.9 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the years ended December 31,\n2020 and 2021. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K for further information on leases.\nFinancing\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper,\nwhich increased from $5.0 billion in September 2021. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate\npurposes. As of December 31, 2021, we had no commercial paper outstanding.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities with no amounts outstanding. In April\n2021, we terminated the existing revolving credit facilities, which were scheduled to expire in July 2023, and entered\ninto two new revolving credit facilities in the amounts of $4.0 billion and $6.0 billion, which will expire in April 2022 and\nApril 2026, respectively. The interest rates for the new credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain\nmarket rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have been\nborrowed under the new credit facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $12.8 billion\nwith short-term and long-term future interest payments of $231 million and $4.0 billion, respectively. See Note 6 of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further\ninformation on our debt.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn April 2021, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $50.0 billion of its\nClass C stock. In July 2021, the Alphabet board approved an amendment to the April 2021 authorization, permitting the\ncompany to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and\nits stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading\n40\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nprices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. In accordance with the authorizations of the Board of Directors\nof Alphabet, during 2021 we repurchased and subsequently retired 20.3 million aggregate shares for $50.3 billion. Of\nthe aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired, 1.2 million shares were Class A stock repurchased for\n$3.4 billion. As of December 31, 2021, $17.4 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases\nunder the amended authorization. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business\nand market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated\ntransactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. See\nNote 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEuropean Commission Fines\nIn 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European\ncompetition law and imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June  27, 2017), €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of\nJune 30, 2018), and €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. While each EC decision is under\nappeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as\nwe provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.\nTaxes\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had short-term and long-term income taxes payable of $784 million and $5.7 billion\nrelated to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). As\npermitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have\ntaxes payable of $3.5 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2021.\nPurchase Commitments\nWe regularly enter into significant non-cancelable contractual obligations primarily related to data center\noperations and build-outs, information technology assets, office buildings, purchases of inventory, and network capacity\narrangements. As of December 31, 2021, such purchase commitments, which do not qualify for recognition on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets, amount to $13.7 billion, of which $11.9 billion is short-term. These amounts represent\nthe non-cancelable portion of agreements or the minimum cancellation fee. For those agreements with variable terms,\nwe do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of December 31,\n2021.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make\nestimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of\nuncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from\nour estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under\nthe circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical accounting\nestimates with the audit and compliance committee of our Board of Directors.\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.\nFair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-\nmarketable equity securities. These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative and are\nmeasured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments resulting from observable price\nchanges for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments require quantitative assessments of\nthe fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs. Pricing adjustments are determined\nby using various valuation methodologies and involve the use of estimates using the best information available, which\nmay include cash flow projections or other available market data.\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the\ncompanies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of\nimpairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market\napproach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount\nrates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others.\nWhen our assessment indicates that an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its fair value.\n41\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e.\nperformance fees. We recognize compensation expense based on the estimated payouts, which may result in expense\nrecognized before investment returns are realized, and may require the use of unobservable inputs.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when\nother changes occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use\nand utilization of assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we\nexpect to benefit from the assets.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating\nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of comparable\nand resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain tax positions\nperiodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as\nwell as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our\nuncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. To\nthe extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect\nthe provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are\nconsidered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous\nexamination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) and other tax authorities which may\nassert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these\nexaminations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings\ninvolving competition, intellectual property, privacy, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial\ndisputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms,\npersonal injury consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for\nsubstantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss\nhas been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has\nbeen previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments\nand changes to our disclosures as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the\nestimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure\nto loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn January 2021, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and certain network equipment.\nIn doing so, we determined we should adjust the estimated useful life. This change in accounting estimate was effective\nbeginning fiscal year 2021 and is detailed further in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included\nin Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates,\nand equity investment risks.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. International revenues, as well as costs and expenses\ndenominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the\nU.S. dollar. Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar,  British pound, Canadian dollar,  Euro, and\nJapanese yen. For the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in\n42\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nforeign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange\nrates of 10% could be experienced in the near term.\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities\ndenominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward contracts reduce, but do\nnot entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign\ncurrency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are offset\nby the gains and losses on the forward contracts.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets, liabilities, and\ncommitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have\nresulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $497 million and $285 million as of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for\nthe years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021.\nWe use foreign currency forwards and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a\ncombination of purchased and written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency options and forwards\nreduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign currency\ncollars and forwards offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging contracts reduce, but do\nnot entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash\nflow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot rate changes as a\ncomponent of AOCI and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the amount recorded in AOCI related to\nour foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $912 million and $1.3 billion lower as\nof December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a\ncorresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency\nrisks related to investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency\ntranslation risk from our foreign operations.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI\nrelated to our net investment hedge would have been approximately $1.0 billion lower as of both December 31, 2020\nand 2021. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency\ntranslation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and\nmaintain liquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities, including those of the U.S. government and its agencies,\ncorporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, money market and other funds, municipal securities, time\ndeposits, asset backed securities, and debt instruments issued by foreign governments. By policy, we limit the amount\nof credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities\ncarry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a\nrise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall.\nUnrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared\nto interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities, we have elected the fair\nvalue option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. We measure securities for\nwhich we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities\nare sold, less any expected credit losses.\nWe use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of\nour marketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our\ninvestment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with 95%\nconfidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of marketable debt securities as of December 31, 2020\nand 2021 are shown below (in millions):\n \nAs of December 31,\n12-Month Average \n\nAs of December 31,\n \n2020\n2021\n2020\n2021\nRisk Category - Interest Rate\n$\n144  $\n139  $\n145  $\n148 \n43\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nActual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the\nsensitivity analyses performed as of December  31, 2020 and 2021 due to the inherent limitations associated with\npredicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is\nnot intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.\nEquity Investment Risk\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that\ncould substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are\ninvestments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily\ndeterminable market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and\nrepresent $5.9 billion and $7.8 billion of our investments as of December  31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. A\nhypothetical adverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2021 balance, which could be experienced in the near\nterm, would decrease the fair value of marketable equity securities by $780 million. From time to time, we may enter\ninto derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for\nobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the\nmeasurement alternative). The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an\nindication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the\nearly stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are\ntypically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition, which\ncould result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. The success of our investment in any\nprivate company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of\ninvestments through liquidity events such as public offerings, acquisitions, private sales or other market events. As of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for\nunder the measurement alternative, was $18.9 billion and $27.6 billion, respectively. Valuations of our equity\ninvestments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. Volatility\nin the global economic climate and financial markets could result in a significant impairment charge relating to our non-\nmarketable equity securities. Changes in valuation of non-marketable equity securities may not directly correlate with\nchanges in valuation of marketable equity securities. Additionally, observable transactions at lower valuations could\nresult in significant losses on our non-marketable equity securities. The effect of COVID-19 on our impairment\nassessment requires significant judgment due to the uncertainty around the duration and severity of the effect.\nThe carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion as\nof December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However,\nthese investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.\nFor further information about our equity investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n44\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nITEM 8.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nAlphabet Inc.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \nPage\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 42)\n46\nFinancial Statements:\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n49\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n50\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n51\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity\n52\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n53\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n54\n45\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alphabet Inc. (the Company) as of December 31,\n2020 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash\nflows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement\nschedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our\nopinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany at December 31, 2020 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 1, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion\nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to\nthose risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in\nthe financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates\nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our\naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion\non the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter\nbelow, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n46\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nLoss Contingencies \nDescription of the\nMatter\nThe Company is regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and\nother proceedings involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, tax and related compliance,\nlabor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by its users, goods and services\noffered by advertisers or publishers using their platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and\nother matters. As described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements “Contingencies”\nsuch claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in\nadverse consequences.\n\nSignificant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood, and the estimated amount, of a\nloss related to such matters. Auditing management’s accounting for and disclosure of loss\ncontingencies from these matters involved challenging and subjective auditor judgment in assessing\nthe Company’s evaluation of the probability of a loss, and the estimated amount or range of loss.\nHow We\nAddressed the\nMatter in Our\nAudit\nWe tested relevant controls over the identified risks associated with management’s accounting for\nand disclosure of these matters. This included controls over management’s assessment of the\nprobability of incurrence of a loss and whether the loss or range of loss was reasonably estimable\nand the development of related disclosures.\n\nOur audit procedures included gaining an understanding of previous rulings issued by regulators\nand the status of ongoing lawsuits, reviewing letters addressing the matters from internal and\nexternal legal counsel, meeting with internal legal counsel to discuss the allegations, and obtaining a\nrepresentation letter from management on these matters. We also evaluated the Company’s\ndisclosures in relation to these matters.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1999.\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 1, 2022\n47\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Alphabet Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Alphabet Inc. (the Company) maintained,\nin all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO\ncriteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the 2021 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 1, 2022\nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was\nmaintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a\nmaterial weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the\nassessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on\nthe financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 1, 2022\n48\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nAlphabet Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except share amounts

All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties, including the effects of COVID-19. On\nan ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; fair values of\nfinancial instruments, intangible assets, and goodwill; useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment;\nincome taxes; and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and\nforward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about\nthe carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nIn January 2021, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from three years to four years and the estimated useful life of certain\nnetwork equipment from three years to five years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal\nyear 2021. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2020 and those\nacquired during the year ended December  31, 2021, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in\ndepreciation expense of $2.6 billion and an increase in net income of $2.0 billion, or $3.02 per basic share and $2.98\nper diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and\nthe collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other\nsimilar taxes are excluded from revenues.\nAdvertising Revenues\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\n•\nGoogle Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners\nwho use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated\nproperties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n•\nYouTube properties; and\n•\nGoogle Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob,\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, and Google\nMarketing Platform, among others.\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for\nperformance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement, such as a click, a view, or a purchase. For brand\nadvertising, we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on\na gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed\non Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues,\nand amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we\ncontrol the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to\nmonetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being\nprimarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\n54\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nGoogle Cloud Revenues\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\n•\nGoogle Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;\n•\nGoogle Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail,\nDocs, Drive, Calendar, and Meet; and\n•\nother enterprise services.\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract\nterms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when\nthe customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services\nprovided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes\nthe benefits of the cloud services.\nGoogle Other Revenues\nGoogle other revenues consist of revenues from:\n•\nGoogle Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play\nstore;\n•\nhardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel phones;\n•\nYouTube non-advertising, which includes YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions; and\n•\nother products and services.\nAs it relates to Google other revenues, the most significant judgment is determining whether we are the principal\nor agent for app sales and in-app purchases through the Google Play store. We report revenues from these\ntransactions on a net basis because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers\nand end users, for which we earn a service fee.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate\nrevenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine\nstandalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus margin.\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration.\nWe estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We\nbelieve that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\nSales Commissions\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred and when the amortization period (the period of the expected\nbenefit) is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions if we expect the period of benefit of\nthese costs to exceed one year and recognize the expense over the amortization period. These costs are recorded\nwithin sales and marketing expenses.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n•\nTAC includes:\n◦\nAmounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services.\nOur distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers,\nand software developers.\n◦\nAmounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n•\nOther cost of revenues includes:\n◦\nContent acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and\nother content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers\nbased on revenues generated or a flat fee).\n55\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n◦\nExpenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses,\ndepreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content\nreview as well as customer and product support costs).\n◦\nInventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software\ncomponent of products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached.\nTechnological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs\nthat meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and\ncloud based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software\napplications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were\nnot material for the periods presented.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity\nclassified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense\nusing the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be\npaid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and\nthe income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nAdditionally, stock-based compensation also includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units\n(PSUs) that include market conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bets. PSUs\nand certain Other Bet awards are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Certain\nOther Bet awards are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement. The fair value of Other Bet\nawards is based on the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $6.8 billion, $5.4\nbillion, and $7.9 billion, respectively.\nPerformance Fees\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain\ninvestments. We recognize compensation expense based on the estimated payouts, which may result in expense\nrecognized before investment returns are realized, and may require the use of unobservable inputs. Performance fees\nare recorded as a component of other income (expense), net.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that\nis determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based\non the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active\nmarkets.\nLevel 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for\nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all\nsignificant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable,\nthese models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based\nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\n56\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents,\nmarketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets\nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and\nliabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\nWe measure certain other instruments, including stock-based compensation awards settled in the stock of certain\nOther Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring\nbasis. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation methods and relevant inputs into\nvaluation models.\nFinancial Instruments\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative\nfinancial instruments and accounts receivable.\nCredit Risks\nWe are subject to credit risk from cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments,\nincluding foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. We manage our credit risk exposure through timely\nassessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management. Foreign exchange\ncontracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically\nunsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. We manage our credit risk\nexposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend.\nWe generally do not require collateral from our customers.\nCash Equivalents\nWe invest excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-\nbacked securities, time deposits, and money market funds.\nMarketable Securities\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have stated maturities of three months or less from the date of\npurchase as cash equivalents and those with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable\ndebt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified\nand accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus reward\nobjectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their stated maturities. As we\nview these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities with maturities\nbeyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We\ncarry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of\nstockholders’ equity, except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded in other\nincome (expense), net. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes\nin fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of\nmarketable debt securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of\nother income (expense), net.\nOur investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses,\nincluding unrealized, recognized in other income (expense), net. We classify our marketable equity securities subject to\nlong-term lock-up restrictions beyond twelve months as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNon-Marketable Securities\nWe account for non-marketable equity securities through which we exercise significant influence but do not have\ncontrol over the investee under the equity method. Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the\nequity method are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the\ncarrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price\nchanges in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Adjustments are determined\nprimarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are recorded as a component of other income\n(expense), net.\nNon-marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.\n57\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nNon-marketable securities that do not have stated contractual maturity dates are classified as other non-current\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nSee Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments.\nAccounts Receivable\nOur payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or\nservices offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or\nservices and customers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts\nreceivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements\nof Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics\nexist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In\ndetermining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status\nand make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider\ncustomer-specific information, current market conditions (such as the effects caused by COVID-19), and reasonable\nand supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.\nThe allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable was $789 million and $550 million as of December 31,\n2020 and 2021, respectively.\nOther\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also have\ncommercial arrangements. For these transactions, judgment is required to assess the substance of the arrangements,\nsuch as the market value of similar transactions or the fair value of the investment based on stand-alone transactions,\nand whether the agreements should be accounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP.\nImpairment of Investments\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment.\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is\nestimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past\nevents, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to other\nincome (expense), net, not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss\nare recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). If we have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely\nthan not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized\ncost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as a component of\nother income (expense), net.\nFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment\nindicators exist by evaluating the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among\nother indicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair\nvalue by recording the corresponding charge as a component of other income (expense), net. We prepare quantitative\nmeasurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.\nInventory\nInventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is\ncomputed using the first-in, first-out method.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in\nwhich we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are\nthe primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or\nbenefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a\nVIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination\nof whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.\n58\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets,\nconstruction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices,\ndata centers, and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network\nequipment. We account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. We compute depreciation\nusing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate. We depreciate\nbuildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets generally over periods of four\nto five years (generally, four years for servers and five years for network equipment).\nWe depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives\nof the assets. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet\nbeen placed in service for our intended use. Depreciation for equipment, buildings, and leasehold improvements\ncommences once they are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-\nlease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily\ninclude payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease\npayments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets\nand liabilities.\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the\nlease assets and liabilities. These amounts include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments\ncontingent on wind or solar production for power purchase arrangements, and payments for maintenance and utilities.\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease\ncommencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our\nincremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental\nborrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments,\nand in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base,\nnon-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any prepaid\nlease payments and lease incentives.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The current portion of our\noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is\nincluded in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease\nliabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm.\nLong-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe review property and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the\nlowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by\ncomparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected\nto generate. If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is\nmeasured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Impairments were not material for the\nperiods presented.\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We evaluate\nour reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting\nunits, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least\nannually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill\nimpairments were not material for the periods presented.\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis\ngenerally over periods ranging from one to twelve years.\n59\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes\npayable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of\nevents that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax\nassets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets\nbased on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely\nthan not that they will not be realized.\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on\ntechnical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the\nfinancial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be\nrealized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the\npurchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values.\nThe excess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nForeign Currency\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange\nrates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for\nrevenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders’\nequity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction\ncurrency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in other income (expense),\nnet.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\nNote 2.

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future\nservices that have not yet been recognized as revenues. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these\ncommitments is largely driven by when our customers utilize services and our ability to deliver in accordance with\nrelevant contract terms, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such as\nrevenues. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be\ninvoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable\ncontracts.\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including\namounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Total deferred\nrevenue as of December  31, 2020 was $3.0 billion, of which $2.3 billion was recognized as revenues for the year\nending December 31, 2021.\nNote 3. Financial Instruments\nDebt Securities\nWe classify our marketable debt securities, which are accounted for as available-for-sale within Level 2 in the fair\nvalue hierarchy, because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models\nutilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value.\nFor certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are\nrecorded in other income (expense), net. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the\nunrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts. Unrealized net gains (losses) related to debt securities\nstill held where we have elected the fair value option were $87 million and $(35) million as of December 31, 2020 and\nDecember  31, 2021, respectively. As of December  31, 2020 and December  31, 2021, the fair value of these debt\nsecurities was $2.0 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively.\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n61\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n The following tables summarize debt securities, for which we did not elect the fair value option, by significant\ninvestment categories as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 (in millions):\n \nAs of December 31, 2020\n \nAdjusted\n\nCost\nGross\n\nUnrealized\n\nGains\nGross\n\nUnrealized\n\nLosses\nFair\n\nValue\nCash and\n\nCash\n\nEquivalents\nMarketable\n\nSecurities\nLevel 2:\nTime deposits\n$\n3,564  $\n0  $\n0  $\n3,564  $\n3,564  $\n0 \nGovernment bonds\n55,156 \n793 \n(9)\n55,940 \n2,527 \n53,413 \nCorporate debt securities\n31,521 \n704 \n(2)\n32,223 \n8 \n32,215 \nMortgage-backed and asset-backed\nsecurities\n16,767 \n364 \n(7)\n17,124 \n0 \n17,124 \nTotal\n$ 107,008  $\n1,861  $\n(18) $ 108,851  $\n6,099  $ 102,752 \n \nAs of December 31, 2021\n \nAdjusted\n\nCost\nGross\n\nUnrealized\n\nGains\nGross\n\nUnrealized\n\nLosses\nFair\n\nValue\nCash and\n\nCash\n\nEquivalents\nMarketable\n\nSecurities\nLevel 2:\nTime deposits\n$\n5,133  $\n0  $\n0  $\n5,133  $\n5,133  $\n0 \nGovernment bonds\n53,288 \n258 \n(238)\n53,308 \n5 \n53,303 \nCorporate debt securities\n35,605 \n194 \n(223)\n35,576 \n12 \n35,564 \nMortgage-backed and asset-backed\nsecurities\n18,829 \n96 \n(112)\n18,813 \n0 \n18,813 \nTotal\n$ 112,855  $\n548  $\n(573) $ 112,830  $\n5,150  $ 107,680 \nThe majority of our time deposits are domestic deposits.\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale or extinguishment of debt securities on a specific identification\nmethod.

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement\nalternative). Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable\ntransactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on\nvaluation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and\nother unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of non-\nmarketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3.\nGains and losses on marketable and non-marketable equity securities\nGains and losses reflected in other income (expense), net, for marketable and non-marketable equity securities\nare summarized below (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2020\n2021\nNet gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period\n$\n1,339  $\n1,196 \nUnrealized gain (loss) on equity securities held as of the end of the period\n4,253 \n11,184 \nTotal gain (loss) recognized in other income (expense), net\n$\n5,592  $\n12,380 \nIn the table above, net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the\nsale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if\nlater. \nCumulative net gains (losses) on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following\ntable (in millions), represents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity security.\nWhile these net gains may have been reflected in periods prior to the period of sale, we believe they are important\nsupplemental information as they reflect the economic net gains recognized on the securities sold during the period.\nCumulative net gains are calculated as the difference between the sale price and the initial purchase price for the\nequity security sold during the period.\n63\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nEquity Securities Sold During the Year\nEnded December 31,\n \n2020\n2021\nTotal sale price\n$\n4,767  $\n5,604 \nTotal initial cost\n2,674 \n1,206 \nCumulative net gains\n$\n2,093  $\n4,398 \nCumulative net gains excludes cumulative losses of $738 million resulting from our equity derivatives, which hedged the\nchanges in fair value of certain marketable equity securities sold during the year ended December 31, 2021.

Our share of gains and losses, including impairments, are\nincluded as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 7 for\nfurther details on other income (expense), net.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary\nrisk managed with derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk\nthat our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency\nexchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and\nenhance investment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value\nand classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option\nstrategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values where both the purchased and\nwritten options are with the same counterparty. For other derivative contracts, we present at gross fair values. We\nprimarily record changes in the fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other income (expense),\nnet, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI, as discussed below.\nWe enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions\nwith the same counterparty. Further, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be\nreceived or pledged when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established\nthresholds. Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are\nincluded in other current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and non-cash collateral pledged related to\nderivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have\nmaturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude the change in\nforward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded component\nis amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues. The difference\nbetween fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. If\nthe hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI are reclassified to\nother income (expense), net in the period of de-designation.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect\nwas $518 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our\ninvestments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the\n65\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and\nlosses of the related hedged items. We exclude changes in forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness\nand recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude changes in\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other\nincome (expense), net.\nOther Derivatives\nOther derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward contracts\nthat we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies\nother than the functional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs, are\nrecognized in other income (expense), net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and\nliabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,\ncommodity prices, credit exposures and to enhance investment returns. Additionally, from time to time, we enter into\nderivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains (losses) arising from\nthese derivatives are reflected within the \"other\" component of other income (expense), net and the offsetting\nrecognized gains (losses) on the marketable equity securities are reflected within the gain (loss) on equity securities,\nnet component of other income (expense), net.

These leases will commence between 2022 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease\nterms of 1 to 25 years.\nNote 5. Variable Interest Entities\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of operations\nand financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $5.7 billion\nand $6.0 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.3 billion and\n$2.5 billion, respectively.\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI), including redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI), in our consolidated\nsubsidiaries was $3.9 billion and $4.3 billion as of December  31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. NCI and RNCI are\nincluded within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period\npresented and is included within the \"other\" component of other income (expense), net. See Note 7 for further details\non other income (expense), net.\nWaymo\nIn June 2021, Waymo, a self-driving technology development company and a consolidated VIE, completed an\ninvestment round of $2.5 billion, the majority of which represented investment from Alphabet. The investments from\nexternal parties were accounted for as equity transactions and resulted in recognition of noncontrolling interests.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies\nthat are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power\ngeneration using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account\nfor these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to these\n70\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nVIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value, and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs\nwere $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively,\nas of December 31, 2021.\nNote 6. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper, which\nincreased from $5.0  billion in September 2021. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate\npurposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt.\nLong-Term Debt\nTotal outstanding debt is summarized below (in millions, except percentages):\nEffective Interest\nRate\nAs of December 31,\nMaturity\nCoupon Rate\n2020\n2021\nDebt\n2011-2020 Notes Issuances\n2024 - 2060\n0.45% - 3.38%\n0.57% - 3.38%\n$\n14,000  $\n13,000 \nFuture finance lease payments, net\n1,201 \n2,086 \n      Total debt\n15,201 \n15,086 \nUnamortized discount and debt\nissuance costs\n(169)\n(156)\nLess: Current portion of Notes\n(999)\n— \nLess: Current portion future finance\nlease payments, net\n(101)\n(113)\n       Total long-term debt\n$\n13,932  $\n14,817 \nNet of imputed interest.\nTotal current portion of long-term debt is included within other accrued expenses and current liabilities. See Note 7.\nThe notes in the table above are comprised of fixed-rate senior unsecured obligations and generally rank equally\nwith each other. We may redeem the notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The effective\ninterest rates are based on proceeds received with interest payable semi-annually.\nThe total estimated fair value of the outstanding notes, including the current portion, was approximately $14.0\nbillion and $12.4 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The fair value was determined\nbased on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as\nLevel 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the aggregate future principal payments for long-term debt, including finance lease\nliabilities, for each of the next five years and thereafter were as follows (in millions):\n2022\n$\n187 \n2023\n146\n2024\n1,159\n2025\n1,162\n2026\n2,165\nThereafter\n10,621\nTotal\n$\n15,440 \nCredit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities.

Acquisitions\nFitbit\nIn January 2021, we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, a leading wearables brand for $2.1 billion. The addition of\nFitbit to Google Services is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices. The assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed were recorded at fair value. The purchase price excludes post acquisition compensation arrangements. The\npurchase price was attributed to $440 million cash acquired, $590 million of intangible assets, $1.2 billion of goodwill\nand $92 million of net liabilities assumed. Goodwill was recorded in the Google Services segment and primarily\nattributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax\npurposes.\nOther Acquisitions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets\nfor total consideration of approximately $885 million, net of cash acquired, of which the total amount of goodwill\nexpected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $118 million.

Contingencies\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate\nactivities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, customers of Google Cloud\nofferings, lessors and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties\nharmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property\ninfringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an\nindemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification\nagreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have a\nlimited history of prior indemnification claims, and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid\nindemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse\neffect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\nLegal Matters\nAntitrust Investigations\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various\nantitrust-related complaints against us.\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and\nranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.4 billion\n($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General Court, and\non September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's\ndecision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the\nGeneral Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January\n20, 2022.\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution\nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30,\n2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision. On\nOctober 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. We recognized a charge of\n$5.1 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2018.\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google\nhad with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5\nbillion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements,\nwhich we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision. We recognized a charge\nof $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.\n76\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on competition matters by\nregulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions. In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative\ndemands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting information and documents relating to our prior\nantitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a\nlawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising.\nSeparately, on December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against Google in\nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. On June 22, 2021, the EC opened a formal investigation into\nGoogle's advertising technology business practices. On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an\nantitrust complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google’s\noperation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. We\nbelieve these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. The DOJ and state Attorneys General\ncontinue their investigations into certain aspects of our business. We continue to cooperate with federal and state\nregulators in the U.S., the EC and other regulators around the world.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these\nlawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change\nour business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for\nus and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly\nbecome an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result\nin a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on\nimportation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into\nthe U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims,\nand may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our\ncustomers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions\nor otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nIn 2010, Oracle America, Inc. (Oracle) brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of\nCalifornia, alleging that Google's Android operating system infringes Oracle's copyrights related to certain Java\napplication programming interfaces (Java APIs). After trial, final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of\nGoogle on June 8, 2016, and the court decided post-trial motions in favor of Google. Oracle appealed and on March\n27, 2018, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for a trial on damages. On May 29,\n2018, we filed a petition for a rehearing at the Federal Circuit, and on August 28, 2018, the Federal Circuit denied the\npetition. On January 24, 2019, we filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. On April 29, 2019, the\nSupreme Court requested the views of the Solicitor General regarding our petition. On September 27, 2019, the\nSolicitor General recommended denying our petition, and we provided our response on October 16, 2019. On\nNovember 15, 2019, the Supreme Court granted our petition and made a decision to review the case. The Supreme\nCourt heard oral arguments in our case on October 7, 2020. On April 5, 2021, the Supreme Court reversed the Federal\nCircuit's ruling and found that Google’s use of the Java APIs was a fair use as a matter of law. The Supreme Court\nremanded the case to the Federal Circuit for further proceedings in conformity with the Supreme Court opinion. On May\n14, 2021, the Federal Circuit entered an order affirming the district court’s final judgment in favor of Google. On June\n21, 2021, the Federal Circuit issued a mandate returning the case to the district court, and the case is now concluded.\nOther\nWe are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and\nconsent decrees involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, tax and related compliance, labor and\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we have a\nnumber of privacy investigations and suits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. Such claims, suits, regulatory and\ngovernment investigations, other proceedings, and consent decrees could result in substantial fines and penalties,\ninjunctive relief, ongoing auditing and monitoring obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our\nbusiness models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could\nharm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n77\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nCertain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We\nrecord a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we\ndisclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of\nliability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make\nadjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being and the\nestimated amount of a loss related to such matters.\nWith respect to our outstanding matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of\nreasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business,\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently\nunpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The\nsubject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the\nsale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue\nnon-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when\na loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of\nloss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of\nthese matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our\nexpectations.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 14.\nNote 11. Stockholders' Equity\nPreferred Stock\nOur Board of Directors has authorized 100 million shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value, issuable in series.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, no shares were issued or outstanding.\nClass A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C\ncapital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect\nto voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock\nis entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law.\nShares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically\nconvert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\nShare Repurchases\nIn April 2021, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $50.0 billion of its\nClass C stock. In July 2021, the Alphabet board approved an amendment to the April 2021 authorization, permitting the\ncompany to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and\nits stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading\nprices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2021, $17.4 billion remains available for\nClass A and Class C share repurchases under the amended authorization.\nIn accordance with the authorizations of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, during the years ended December 31,\n2020 and 2021, we repurchased and subsequently retired 21.5 million and 20.3 million aggregate shares for $31.1\nbillion and $50.3 billion, respectively. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired during 2021, 1.2\nmillion shares were Class A stock for $3.4 billion.\nStock Split Effected in Form of Stock Dividend (“Stock Split”)\nOn February 1, 2022, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-for-\none stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the Company’s Class A, Class B, and\nClass C stock. The Stock Split is subject to stockholder approval of an amendment to the Company’s Amended and\nRestated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Class A, Class B, and Class C\nstock to accommodate the Stock Split.\n78\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nIf approval is obtained, each of the Company’s stockholders of record at the close of business on July 1, 2022 (the\n“Record Date”), will receive, after the close of business on July 15, 2022, a dividend of 19 additional shares of the same\nclass of stock for every share held by such stockholder as of the Record Date.\nNote 12. Net Income Per Share\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive\nsecurities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other\ncontingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable\nshares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the\ndiluted net income per share of Class A stock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income\nper share of Class B stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock\nare identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of\nincorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per\nshare dividends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to\nour certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a\ngiven class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In\naddition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it\nmust be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each\nyear are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A, Class B, and Class C stock as if the\nearnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed\nearnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the net income per share amounts are the same for\nClass A, Class B, and Class C stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or\ndistributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.\nThe following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A, Class B, and\nClass C stock (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2019\n \nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\nBasic net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$\n14,846 \n$\n2,307 \n$\n17,190 \nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n299,402 \n46,527 \n346,667 \nBasic net income per share\n$\n49.59 \n$\n49.59 \n$\n49.59 \nDiluted net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation\n$\n14,846 \n$\n2,307 \n$\n17,190 \nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A\nshares\n2,307 \n0 \n0 \nReallocation of undistributed earnings\n(126)\n(20)\n126 \nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$\n17,027 \n$\n2,287 \n$\n17,316 \nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in basic computation\n299,402 \n46,527 \n346,667 \nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities\nAdd:\nConversion of Class B to Class A shares outstanding\n46,527 \n0 \n0 \nRestricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares\n413 \n0 \n5,547 \nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n346,342 \n46,527 \n352,214 \nDiluted net income per share\n$\n49.16 \n$\n49.16 \n$\n49.16 \n79\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2020\n \nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\nBasic net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$\n17,733 \n$\n2,732 \n$\n19,804 \nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n299,815 \n46,182 \n334,819 \nBasic net income per share\n$\n59.15 \n$\n59.15 \n$\n59.15 \nDiluted net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation\n$\n17,733 \n$\n2,732 \n$\n19,804 \nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A\nshares\n2,732 \n0 \n0 \nReallocation of undistributed earnings\n(180)\n(25)\n180 \nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$\n20,285 \n$\n2,707 \n$\n19,984 \nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in basic computation\n299,815 \n46,182 \n334,819 \nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities\nAdd:\nConversion of Class B to Class A shares outstanding\n46,182 \n0 \n0 \nRestricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares\n87 \n0 \n6,125 \nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n346,084 \n46,182 \n340,944 \nDiluted net income per share\n$\n58.61 \n$\n58.61 \n$\n58.61 \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2021\n \nClass A\nClass B\nClass C\nBasic net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$\n34,200 \n$\n5,174 \n$\n36,659 \nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n300,310 \n45,430 \n321,910 \nBasic net income per share\n$\n113.88 \n$\n113.88 \n$\n113.88 \nDiluted net income per share:\nNumerator\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation\n$\n34,200 \n$\n5,174 \n$\n36,659 \nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A\nshares\n5,174 \n0 \n0 \nReallocation of undistributed earnings\n(581)\n(77)\n581 \nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n$\n38,793 \n$\n5,097 \n$\n37,240 \nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in basic computation\n300,310 \n45,430 \n321,910 \nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities\nAdd:\nConversion of Class B to Class A shares outstanding\n45,430 \n0 \n0 \nRestricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares\n15 \n0 \n10,009 \nNumber of shares used in per share computation\n345,755 \n45,430 \n331,919 \nDiluted net income per share\n$\n112.20 \n$\n112.20 \n$\n112.20 \n80\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nNote 13. Compensation Plans\nStock Plans\nOur stock plans include the Alphabet Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Plan, the Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan and\nOther Bet stock-based plans. Under our stock plans, RSUs and other types of awards may be granted. An RSU award\nis an agreement to issue shares of our Class C stock at the time the award vests. RSUs generally vest over four years\ncontingent upon employment on the vesting date.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were 37,479,707 shares of Class C stock reserved for future issuance under the\nAlphabet 2021 Stock Plan.\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, total stock-based compensation expense was $11.7\nbillion, $13.4 billion, and $15.7 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock\nof $10.8 billion, $12.8 billion, and $15.0 billion, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, we recognized tax benefits on total stock-based\ncompensation expense, which are reflected in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome, of $1.8 billion, $2.7 billion, and $3.1 billion, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, tax benefit realized related to awards vested or\nexercised during the period was $2.2 billion, $3.6 billion, and $5.9 billion, respectively. These amounts do not include\nthe indirect effects of stock-based awards, which primarily relate to the R&D tax credit.\nStock-Based Award Activities\nThe following table summarizes the activities for unvested Alphabet RSUs for the year ended December 31,\n2021:\nUnvested Restricted Stock Units\n \n    Number of    \n\nShares\nWeighted-\n\nAverage\n\nGrant-Date\n\nFair Value\nUnvested as of December 31, 2020\n19,288,793  $\n1,262.13 \nGranted\n10,582,700  $\n1,949.16 \nVested\n(11,209,486) $\n1,345.98 \nForfeited/canceled\n(1,767,294) $\n1,425.48 \nUnvested as of December 31, 2021\n16,894,713  $\n1,626.13 \nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2019 and\n2020 was $1,092.36 and $1,407.97, respectively. Total fair value of RSUs, as of their respective vesting dates, during\nthe years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021 were $15.2 billion, $17.8 billion, and $28.8 billion, respectively.\nAs of December  31, 2021, there was $25.8 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested\nemployee RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years.\n401(k) Plans\nWe have two 401(k) Savings Plans  that qualify as deferred salary arrangements under Section  401(k) of the\nInternal Revenue Code. Under these 401(k) Plans, matching contributions are based upon the amount of the\nemployees’ contributions subject to certain limitations. We recognized expense of approximately $724 million, $855\nmillion, and $916 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively.\nNote 14.

As of December 31, 2019, we have simplified our corporate legal entity structure and\nnow license intellectual property from the U.S. that was previously licensed from Bermuda resulting in an increase in\nthe portion of our income earned in the U.S.\nOn July 27, 2015, the U.S. Tax Court, in an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, invalidated the portion of the\nTreasury regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring related-party participants in a cost sharing arrangement to\nshare stock-based compensation costs. The U.S. Tax Court issued the final decision on December 28, 2015. As a\nresult of that decision, we recorded a tax benefit related to the anticipated reimbursement of cost share payment for\npreviously shared stock-based compensation costs.\nOn June 7, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned the 2015 Tax Court decision in Altera\nCorp. v. Commissioner, and upheld the portion of the Treasury regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring\nrelated-party participants in a cost sharing arrangement to share stock-based compensation costs. As a result of the\nNinth Circuit court decision, our cumulative net tax benefit of $418 million related to previously shared stock-based\ncompensation costs was reversed in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIn 2020, there was an increase in valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets that are not likely to be realized\nrelating to certain of our Other Bets.\n82\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and\nliabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n2020\n2021\nDeferred tax assets:\nAccrued employee benefits\n$\n580  $\n549 \nAccruals and reserves not currently deductible\n1,049 \n1,816 \nTax credits\n3,723 \n5,179 \nNet operating losses\n1,085 \n1,790 \nOperating leases\n2,620 \n2,503 \nIntangible assets\n1,525 \n2,034 \nOther\n981 \n925 \nTotal deferred tax assets\n11,563 \n14,796 \nValuation allowance\n(4,823)\n(7,129)\nTotal deferred tax assets net of valuation allowance\n6,740 \n7,667 \nDeferred tax liabilities:\nProperty and equipment, net\n(3,382)\n(5,237)\nNet investment gains\n(1,901)\n(3,229)\nOperating leases\n(2,354)\n(2,228)\nOther\n(1,580)\n(946)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(9,217)\n(11,640)\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities)\n$\n(2,477) $\n(3,973)\nAs of December 31, 2021, our federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes\nwere approximately $5.6 billion, $4.6 billion, and $1.7 billion respectively. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss\ncarryforwards will begin to expire in 2023, foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025 and the\nstate net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028. It is more likely than not that certain net operating\nloss carryforwards will not be realized; therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance against them. The net\noperating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under the tax laws of the different jurisdictions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our California R&D carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $5.0\nbillion that can be carried over indefinitely. We believe the state tax credit is not likely to be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our investment tax credit carryforwards for state income tax purposes were\napproximately $700  million and will begin to expire in 2025. We use the flow-through method of accounting for\ninvestment tax credits. We believe this tax credit is not likely to be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to California deferred tax assets,\ncertain federal net operating losses, certain state tax credits, net deferred tax assets relating to certain Other Bets, and\ncertain foreign net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized. We continue to reassess the remaining\nvaluation allowance quarterly, and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax\nbenefit will be recorded accordingly.\n83\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2019\n2020\n2021\nBeginning gross unrecognized tax benefits\n$\n4,652  $\n3,377  $\n3,837 \nIncreases related to prior year tax positions\n938 \n372 \n529 \nDecreases related to prior year tax positions\n(143)\n(557)\n(263)\nDecreases related to settlement with tax authorities\n(2,886)\n(45)\n(329)\nIncreases related to current year tax positions\n816 \n690 \n1,384 \nEnding gross unrecognized tax benefits\n$\n3,377  $\n3,837  $\n5,158 \nThe total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $3.4 billion, $3.8 billion, and $5.2 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively, of which $2.3 billion, $2.6 billion, and $3.7 billion, if recognized,\nwould affect our effective tax rate, respectively.\nAs of December  31, 2020 and 2021, we accrued $222 million and $270 million in interest and penalties in\nprovision for income taxes, respectively.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two\nmajor tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax\nreturns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2018 tax returns. We\nhave also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent\nestablishment. We continue to defend any and all such claims as presented.\nThe tax years 2014 through 2020 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for\nIrish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial\nstatements.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the\nadequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax\nauthorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.\nHowever, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are\nresolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for\nincome taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is\nnot certain, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state and non U.S. tax\npositions could decrease by approximately $2.0 billion in the next 12 months. Positions that may be resolved include\nvarious U.S. and non-U.S. matters.\nNote 15. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n•\nGoogle Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps,\nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of\napps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based\nproducts such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\n•\nGoogle Cloud includes Google’s infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for\nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform\nservices, Google Workspace collaboration tools and other enterprise services.\n•\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from\nOther Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. The associated costs, including depreciation and impairment, are allocated\nto operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage or headcount.\n84\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nUnallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and\nlegal, including certain fines and settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared R&D activities.\nAdditionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are included in corporate costs.\nOur operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\nInformation about segments during the periods presented were as follows (in millions).

The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance the flow of\nfinancial information, improve data management and provide timely information to our management team. The\nimplementation is expected to continue in phases over the next few years. We completed the implementation of certain\nof our subledgers, which included changes to our processes, procedures and internal controls over financial reporting\nduring the second quarter of 2021. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that\noccurred during the quarter ended December  31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. However, as the phased implementation of the new ERP\nsystem continues, we will change our processes and procedures, which in turn, could result in changes to our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. As such changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially\naffect our internal control over financial reporting.\nAs a result of COVID-19, our global workforce continued to operate primarily in a work from home environment for\nthe quarter ended December 31, 2021. While we continue to evolve our work model in response to the uneven effects\nof the ongoing pandemic around the world, we believe that our internal controls over financial reporting continue to be\neffective. We have continued to re-evaluate and refine our financial reporting process to provide reasonable assurance\nthat we could report our financial results accurately and in a timely manner.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,\nas defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation,\nmanagement concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December  31, 2021.\nManagement reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit and Compliance Committee. The effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting as of December  31, 2021 has been audited by Ernst  & Young LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls\nand procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the\ndesired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible\ncontrols and procedures relative to their costs.\nITEM 9B.\nOTHER INFORMATION\nNone.\n86\n\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nITEM 9C.

This summary is subject to and qualified by the\nprovisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (“Certificate of Incorporation”), Amended and Restated\nBylaws (“Bylaws”), the terms of our Class C Undertaking (as defined below), and certain Transfer Restriction Agreements (as\ndefined below), copies of which are incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, the Delaware General Corporation Law\n(“DGCL”), as amended, also affects the terms of our capital stock.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides for (1) the Class A Common Stock, which has one vote per share; (2) the Class B\nCommon Stock, which has 10 votes per share; and (3) the Class C Capital Stock, which has no voting rights unless otherwise\nrequired by law. Our Certificate of Incorporation also provides for 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock.\nCapital Stock\nAuthorized Capital Stock\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 15,100,000,000 shares, each with a par value of $0.001 per share, of which:\n•\n9,000,000,000 shares are designated as Class A Common Stock;\n•\n3,000,000,000 shares are designated as Class B Common Stock;\n•\n3,000,000,000 shares are designated as Class C Capital Stock; and\n•\n100,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock.\nAt December 31, 2021, there were 300,736,598 shares of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding, 44,664,772 shares of\nClass B Common Stock issued and outstanding, and 316,719,697 shares of Class C Capital Stock issued and outstanding. At that\ndate, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding. All of the outstanding shares of the Company’s capital stock are fully\npaid and nonassessable.\nVoting Rights\nHolders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock have identical rights, except that holders of shares of\nClass A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of shares of Class B Common Stock are entitled to 10 votes\nper share. Holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock vote together as a single class on all matters\n(including the election of directors) submitted to a vote of stockholders, unless otherwise required by law.\nHolders of shares of Class C Capital Stock have no voting rights, unless otherwise required by law.\nThe DGCL could require the holders of any of the shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock, or Class C Capital\nStock to vote separately as a single class in the following circumstances:\n•\nIf we amended our Certificate of Incorporation to increase or decrease the par value of the shares of a class of\nstock, then the holders of the shares of that class would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed\namendment.\n\n•\nIf we amended our Certificate of Incorporation in a manner that altered or changed the powers, preferences, or\nspecial rights of the shares of a class of stock so as to affect them adversely, then the holders of the shares of\nthat class would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed amendment.\nAs permitted by the DGCL and as set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock,\nClass B Common Stock, and Class C Capital Stock do not have the right to vote separately as a single class if the number of\nauthorized shares of such class is increased or decreased. Rather, the number of authorized shares of Class A Common Stock, Class\nB Common Stock, and Class C Capital Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then\noutstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A\nCommon Stock and Class B Common Stock, voting together as a single class.\nWe have not provided for cumulative voting for the election of directors.\nDividends\nSubject to preferences that may apply to any shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of shares of Class A\nCommon Stock, Class B Common Stock, and Class C Capital Stock will be entitled to share equally, on a per share basis, in any\ndividends that our Board of Directors may determine to issue from time to time. In the event that a dividend is paid in the form of\nshares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, or rights to acquire shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B\nCommon Stock, (1) the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock shall receive Class A Common Stock, or rights to acquire\nshares of Class A Common Stock, as the case may be; (2) the holders of shares of Class B Common Stock shall receive shares of\nClass B Common Stock, or rights to acquire shares of Class B Common Stock, as the case may be; and (3) the holders of shares of\nClass C Capital Stock shall receive shares of Class C Capital Stock, or rights to acquire shares of Class C Capital Stock, as the case\nmay be.\nLiquidation Rights\nUpon our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall\nbe entitled to share equally in all assets remaining after the payment of any liabilities and the liquidation preferences on any\noutstanding preferred stock. Immediately prior to the earlier of (1) any distribution of our assets in connection with a liquidation,\ndissolution, or winding-up, or (2) any record date established to determine the holders of our capital stock entitled to receive such\ndistribution, each share of Class C Capital Stock shall automatically be converted into one share of Class A Common Stock.\nConversion\nShares of Class A Common Stock are not convertible into any other shares of our capital stock.\nOther than in connection with a liquidation as described above, shares of Class C Capital Stock are not convertible into any other\nshares of our capital stock.\nEach share of Class B Common Stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of Class A Common\nStock upon written notice to our transfer agent. In addition, each share of Class B Common Stock shall convert automatically into\none share of Class A Common Stock upon any transfer, whether or not for value, except for certain transfers described in our\nCertificate of Incorporation, including the following:\n2\n\n•\nTransfers between Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founders, subject to the requirements of the\nTransfer Restriction Agreements, as amended (as described below).\n•\nTransfers for tax and estate planning purposes, including to trusts, corporations, and partnerships established or\ncontrolled by a holder of Class B Common Stock.\nIn addition, partnerships or limited liability companies that held more than 5% of the total outstanding shares of Class B Common\nStock as of the closing of Google’s initial public offering in 2004 may distribute their shares of Class B Common Stock to their\nrespective partners or members (who may further distribute the shares of Class B Common Stock to their respective partners or\nmembers) without triggering a conversion to shares of Class A Common Stock. Such distributions must be conducted in\naccordance with the ownership interests of such partners or members and the terms of any agreements binding the partnership or\nlimited liability company.\nThe death of any holder of shares of Class B Common Stock who is a natural person will result in the conversion of his or her\nshares of Class B Common Stock, and any shares held by his or her permitted entities, into shares of Class A Common Stock.\nHowever, subject to the terms of the Transfer Restriction Agreements, either of Larry or Sergey may transfer voting control of his\nshares of Class B Common Stock and those held by his permitted entities to the other contingent or effective upon his death without\ntriggering a conversion into shares of Class A Common Stock, but the shares of Class B Common Stock so transferred will convert\nto Class A Common Stock nine months after the death of the transferring founder.\nOnce transferred and converted into shares of Class A Common Stock, shares of Class B Common Stock shall not be reissued.\nNo class of our capital stock may be subdivided or combined unless the other classes of capital stock are concurrently subdivided\nor combined in the same proportion and in the same manner.\nEqual Status\nExcept as expressly provided in our Certificate of Incorporation, shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock\nhave the same rights and privileges and rank equally, share ratably and are identical in all respects as to all matters. In the event of\nany merger, consolidation, or other business combination requiring the approval of our stockholders entitled to vote thereon\n(whether or not we are the surviving entity), the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock shall have the right to receive, or the\nright to elect to receive, the same form of consideration as the holders of shares of Class B Common Stock, and the holders of\nshares of Class A Common Stock shall have the right to receive, or the right to elect to receive, at least the same amount of\nconsideration on a per share basis as the holders of shares of Class B Common Stock. In the event of any (1) tender or exchange\noffer to acquire any shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock by any third party pursuant to an agreement to\nwhich we are a party, or (2) any tender or exchange offer by us to acquire any shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B\nCommon Stock, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock shall have the right to receive, or the right to elect to receive, the\nsame form of consideration as the holders of shares of Class B Common Stock, and the holders of shares of Class A Common\nStock shall have the right to receive, or the right to elect to receive, at least the same amount of consideration on a per share basis as\nthe holders of shares of Class B Common Stock.\nExcept as expressly provided in our Certificate of Incorporation, shares of Class C Capital Stock have the same rights and\nprivileges and rank equally, share ratably and are identical in all respects to the shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B\nCommon Stock as to all matters. In the event of any merger, consolidation, or other business combination requiring the approval of\nour stockholders entitled to vote thereon (whether or not we are the surviving entity), the holders of shares of Class C Capital Stock\nshall receive the same amount and form of\n3\n\nconsideration on a per share basis as the consideration, if any, received by holders of shares of Class A Common Stock in\nconnection with such merger, consolidation or combination (and if holders of shares of Class A Common Stock are entitled to make\nan election as to the amount or form of consideration that such holders shall receive in any such merger, consolidation or\ncombination with respect to their shares of Class A Common Stock, then the holders of shares of Class C Capital Stock shall be\nentitled to make the same election as to their shares of Class C Capital Stock). In the event of any (1) tender or exchange offer to\nacquire any shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock by any third party pursuant to an agreement to which we\nare a party, or (2) any tender or exchange offer by us to acquire any shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock,\nthe holders of shares of Class C Capital Stock shall receive the same amount and form of consideration on a per share basis as the\nconsideration received by holders of shares of Class A Common Stock (and if holders of shares of Class A Common Stock are\nentitled to make an election as to the amount or form of consideration that such holders shall receive in any such tender or\nexchange offer with respect to their shares of Class A Common Stock, then the holders of shares of Class C Capital Stock shall be\nentitled to make the same election as to their shares of Class C Capital Stock).\nClass C Settlement Agreement\nIn connection with the adjustment of Google’s capital structure by establishing the Google Class C Capital Stock, and the dividend\nof one share of Google Class C Capital Stock for each share of Google Class A Common Stock and Google Class B Common\nStock outstanding on March 27, 2014 (the “Class C dividend”), on October 28, 2013, the Delaware Court of Chancery approved a\nsettlement entered into by Google, the Board of Directors of Google and the plaintiffs in the class action litigation involving the\nauthorization to distribute Google Class C Capital Stock captioned In Re: Google Inc. Class C Shareholder Litigation, Civil Action\nNo. 7469-CS. The parties subsequently filed a Revised Stipulation of Compromise and Settlement with the Court, which issued an\nOrder and Final Judgment on November 6, 2013 that fully approved the parties’ settlement agreement (the “Google Class C\nSettlement”). Additionally, on October 2, 2015, we entered into a Class C Undertaking pertaining to the Google Class C Settlement,\npursuant to which Alphabet will undertake, with respect to the Alphabet securities, to be bound by the restrictions, undertakings\nand all continuing obligations and to benefit from the rights of the Google Class C Settlement Agreement that are applicable to\nGoogle as if Alphabet were Google (the “Class C Undertaking”).\nThe terms of the Class C Undertaking require us to: (i) ensure that the Transfer Restriction Agreements (defined below) entered\ninto by Larry, our Co-Founder and director; Sergey, our Co-Founder and director; and Eric E. Schmidt, our significant stockholder;\nand certain of their respective affiliates cannot be waived or amended unless such amendment or waiver is first considered and\nrecommended by a committee of two or more of the independent directors of our Board of Directors who do not hold Class B\nCommon Stock, and then approved by every member of our Board of Directors, excluding Larry and Sergey; (ii) ensure that any\nwaiver or amendment of the Transfer Restriction Agreements will be publicly disclosed at least 30 days before such waiver or\namendment takes effect on a Form 8-K, Form 10-Q or Form 10-K; (iii) effective for three years from the Class C dividend payment\ndate, prior to issuing more than 10 million shares of Class C Capital Stock as consideration in an acquisition or other business\ncombination (excluding assumptions or conversions of equity for employees of acquired or combined companies), have our\nindependent directors consider the effects of issuing such shares on our holders of Class A Common Stock and upon the company\nas a whole; and (iv) when the aggregate voting power of Larry and Sergey falls below 15% of the cumulative voting power of all\nour shareholders, have our Board of Directors consider in good faith whether it is no longer in our best interests to maintain a class\nof nonvoting stock and, if it so determines, take steps to cause the Class C Capital Stock to convert into Class A Common Stock.\nTransfer Restriction Agreements\nOn October 2, 2015, we entered into a transfer restriction agreement with each of Larry, Sergey, Eric and certain of their respective\naffiliates (collectively, the “Transfer Restriction Agreements”). On December 31, 2021, we entered\n4\n\ninto a joinder to Sergey’s transfer restriction agreement with certain of his other affiliates. The Transfer Restriction Agreements are\nintended to limit the ability of Larry, Sergey, and Eric to sell their Alphabet stock in a manner that does not reduce their voting\npower. Under the Transfer Restriction Agreements, the parties are bound, without any modification, by the same restrictions,\nundertakings and obligations that are imposed under the transfer restriction agreements, related joinders and other documentation\nentered into with Google on March 25, 2014 in connection with the Google Class C Settlement (the “Google Transfer Restriction\nAgreements”).\nPursuant to the Transfer Restriction Agreements, none of Larry, Sergey, Eric, or certain of their respective affiliates that are party to\nthe agreements (generally, trusts and other estate planning vehicles through which Larry, Sergey, and Eric hold all or a portion of\ntheir shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or Class C Capital Stock) may sell, assign, transfer, convey or\nhypothecate any shares of Class C Capital Stock if, as a result of such sale, transfer, conveyance or hypothecation, they, together\nwith certain of their respective affiliates, would own more shares of Class B Common Stock than shares of Class C Capital Stock.\nIf at any time either Larry, Sergey, or Eric, in each case together with certain of his respective affiliates, owns more shares of Class\nB Common Stock than shares of Class C Capital Stock, then Larry, Sergey, or Eric, as the case may be, and his respective affiliates,\nwill be deemed to have automatically converted that number of shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common\nStock such that after such conversion he and his affiliates own an equal number of shares of Class B Common Stock as he and his\naffiliates own of shares of Class C Capital Stock. The required maximum ratio of shares of Class B Common Stock to shares of\nClass C Capital Stock owned by Larry, Sergey and Eric is subject to adjustment in connection with certain dividends, stock splits,\ndistributions or recapitalizations.\nLarry, Sergey, Eric, and certain of their respective affiliates that are party to the Transfer Restriction Agreements may transfer\nshares of Class B Common Stock to their affiliates as permitted by the terms of our Certificate of Incorporation only if,\nimmediately following such transfer, Larry, Sergey, or Eric, as the case may be, and his respective affiliates, would own an\naggregate number of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to or less than the number of shares of Class C Capital Stock that he\nand his affiliates own. Additionally, Larry, Sergey, Eric, and certain of their respective affiliates that are party to the Transfer\nRestriction Agreements may transfer shares of Class C Capital Stock to their affiliates only if, immediately following such transfer,\nLarry, Sergey, or Eric, as the case may be, and his respective affiliates, would own an aggregate number of shares of Class B\nCommon Stock equal to or less than the number of shares of Class C Capital Stock that he and his affiliates own. However, each of\nLarry and his affiliates that are party to his Transfer Restriction Agreement and Sergey and his affiliates that are party to his\nTransfer Restriction Agreement may not transfer shares of Class B Common Stock to another person in a transfer that does not\nresult in the automatic conversion of such shares of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock pursuant to the terms of\nthe Certificate of Incorporation unless Larry or Sergey, as the case may be, and his respective affiliates, transfer, in the same\nmanner and to the same extent, an equal number of shares of Class C Capital Stock to the transferee.\nIn the event of (1) any merger, consolidation, or other business combination requiring the approval of the holders of our capital\nstock (whether or not Alphabet is the surviving entity), or the acquisition of all or substantially all of our assets, (2) any tender or\nexchange offer by any third party to acquire a majority of the shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or Class C\nCapital Stock, or (3) any tender or exchange offer by us to acquire any shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock,\nor Class C Capital Stock, none of Larry, Sergey, Eric, and certain of their respective affiliates that are party to the Transfer\nRestriction Agreements may sell, transfer or exchange, directly or indirectly, any shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B\nCommon Stock, or Class C Capital Stock in connection with such transaction or in a related transaction for (a) with respect to their\nshares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, an amount per share greater than the holders of shares of Class A\nCommon Stock receive in such transaction or a form of consideration different from the form that the holders of shares of Class A\nCommon Stock would receive, or may elect to receive, in such transaction; or (b) with respect to their shares of Class C Capital\nStock, an amount per share greater than the holders of shares of Class C Capital Stock\n5\n\nreceive in such transaction or a form of consideration different from the form that the holders of shares of Class C Capital Stock\nwould receive, or may elect to receive, in such transaction (the “Founder Equal Treatment Provision”).\nWith respect to Larry, Sergey, and certain of their respective affiliates, the applicable Transfer Restriction Agreements generally\nterminate when they collectively hold less than 34% of our total outstanding voting power. However, the Founder Equal Treatment\nProvision never terminates.\nWith respect to Eric and certain of his affiliates, the applicable Transfer Restriction Agreement generally terminates when they\ncollectively hold less than 2% of our total outstanding voting power. However, the Founder Equal Treatment Provision never\nterminates.\nAs required under the terms of the Class C Settlement Agreement, the Transfer Restriction Agreements may only be amended or\nwaived if such amendment or waiver is (i) first considered and recommended by a committee of two or more independent directors\nof our Board of Directors who do not hold Class B Common Stock and (ii) then approved by every member of our Board of\nDirectors, excluding Larry and Sergey. Any Transfer Restriction Agreement amendment or waiver will be publicly disclosed by\nAlphabet on a Form 8-K, Form 10-Q or Form 10-K at least 30 days before such amendment or waiver takes effect.\nPreferred Stock\nWe are authorized to issue, without approval by our stockholders, up to a total of 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or\nmore series. Our Board of Directors may establish the number of shares to be included in each such series and may fix the\ndesignations, preferences, powers, and other rights, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the shares of a series of\npreferred stock. Our Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could\ndilute the voting power or rights of the holders of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock. The\nissuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes,\ncould, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Alphabet and might harm the\nmarket price of our Class A Common Stock or Class C Capital Stock.\nThe particular terms of any series of preferred stock offered by us may include:\n•\nthe number of shares of the preferred stock being offered;\n•\nthe title and liquidation preference per share of the preferred stock;\n•\nthe purchase price of the preferred stock;\n•\nthe dividend rate or method for determining the dividend rate;\n•\nthe dates on which dividends will be paid;\n•\nwhether dividends on the preferred stock will be cumulative or noncumulative and, if cumulative, the dates\nfrom which dividends shall commence to accumulate;\n•\nany redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the preferred stock;\n•\nany securities exchange on which the preferred stock may be listed; and\n6\n\n•\nany additional dividend, liquidation, redemption, sinking fund and other rights and restrictions applicable to the\npreferred stock.\nHolders of preferred stock will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, cash dividends at the rates\nand on the dates established by such series of preferred stock. Dividend rates may be fixed or variable or both. Different series of\npreferred stock may be entitled to dividends at different dividend rates or based upon different methods of determination. Each\ndividend will be payable to the holders of record as they appear on our stock books on record dates determined by our Board of\nDirectors. Dividends on preferred stock may be cumulative or noncumulative. If our Board of Directors fails to declare a dividend\non any preferred stock for which dividends are noncumulative, then the right to receive that dividend will be lost, and we will have\nno obligation to pay the dividend for that dividend period, whether or not dividends are declared for any future dividend period.\nAny series of preferred stock may be redeemable in whole or in part at our option. In addition, any series of preferred stock may be\nsubject to mandatory redemption pursuant to a sinking fund.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and of Delaware Law\nCertain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and of the DGCL could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or\ndiscouraging another party from acquiring control of us. In particular, our capital structure concentrates ownership of our voting\nstock in the hands of Larry, Sergey, and Eric. These provisions, which are summarized below, are expected to discourage coercive\ntakeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire\ncontrol of us to first negotiate with our Board of Directors. However, these provisions could also have the effect of discouraging\nothers from attempting hostile takeovers and, as a consequence, they may also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of\nour Class A Common Stock or Class C Capital Stock that often result from actual or rumored hostile takeover attempts. These\nprovisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. It is possible that these provisions could make it\nmore difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests.\nThree Classes of Stock\nAs discussed above, our Class B Common Stock has 10 votes per share, while our Class A Common Stock has one vote per share\nand our Class C Capital Stock has no voting rights (unless otherwise required by law). As a result of their ownership of a\nsubstantial portion of our Class B Common Stock, Larry and Sergey currently have the ability to elect all of our directors and to\ndetermine the outcome of most matters submitted for a vote of our stockholders. This concentrated voting control could discourage\nothers from initiating any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as\nbeneficial.\nBecause the Class C Capital Stock has no voting rights (except as required by law), the issuance of Class C Capital Stock will not\nresult in voting dilution to the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock. As a result, the issuance of\nClass C Capital Stock could prolong the duration of Larry and Sergey’s current relative ownership of our voting power and their\nability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders.\nSo long as Larry and Sergey have the ability to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders,\nthird parties may be deterred in their willingness to make an unsolicited merger, takeover, or other change of control proposal, or to\nengage in a proxy contest for the election of directors. As a result, our three classes of stock may have the effect of depriving our\nstockholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices and make it more difficult to replace\nour directors and management.\n7\n\nSpecial Approval for Change in Control Transactions\nIn the event a person seeks to acquire us by means of a merger or consolidation transaction, a purchase of all or substantially all of\nour assets, or an issuance of our voting securities representing more than 2% of our outstanding shares at the time of issuance and\nthat results in any person or group owning more than 50% of our outstanding voting power, then these types of acquisition\ntransactions must be approved by our stockholders at an annual or special meeting. At this meeting, we must obtain the approval of\nstockholders representing the greater of:\n•\na majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock; and\n•\n60% of the voting power of the shares of capital stock present in person or represented by proxy at the\nstockholder meeting and entitled to vote.\nLimits on Ability of Stockholders to Act by Written Consent\nWe have provided in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws that our stockholders may not act by written consent. This limit\non the ability of our stockholders to act by written consent may lengthen the amount of time required to take stockholder actions.\nAs a result, no stockholder, regardless of how large its holdings of our stock are, would be able to amend our Bylaws or remove\ndirectors without holding a stockholders meeting.\nUndesignated Preferred Stock\nThe ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with\nvoting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us. These and other provisions may\nhave the effect of deferring or preventing hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our\ncompany.\nRequirements for Advance Notification of Stockholder Nominations and Proposals\nOur Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for\nelection as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of our Board of Directors or a committee of our Board of\nDirectors. The Bylaws do not give our Board of Directors the power to approve or disapprove stockholder nominations of\ncandidates or proposals regarding business to be conducted at a special or annual meeting of the stockholders. However, our\nBylaws may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed.\nThese provisions may also discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s\nown slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\nDelaware Anti-Takeover Statute\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL regulating corporate takeovers. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly-held\nDelaware corporation from engaging, under certain circumstances, in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a\nperiod of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder unless:\n•\nprior to the date of the transaction, the Board of Directors of the corporation approved either the business\ncombination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;\n8\n\n•\nupon completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the\nstockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction\ncommenced, excluding for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding (1) shares owned by\npersons who are directors and also officers and (2) shares owned by employee stock plans in which employee\nparticipants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be\ntendered in a tender or exchange offer; or\n•\non or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by the Board of Directors\nand authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative\nvote of at least 66 2⁄3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder.\nGenerally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the\ninterested stockholder. An interested stockholder is a person who owns 15% or more of a corporation’s outstanding voting\nsecurities, or is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder\nstatus did own 15% or more of a corporation’s outstanding voting securities, and affiliates and associates of such person. The\nexistence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions our Board of Directors does not approve in\nadvance. Section 203 may also discourage attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of capital\nstock held by stockholders.\nListing\nOur Class C Capital Stock and Class A Common Stock are listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbols\n“GOOG” and “GOOGL” respectively. Our Class B Common Stock is not listed on any stock market or exchange.\n9\n\nExhibit 10.07.2\n         \nALPHABET INC.\n2021 STOCK PLAN\nALPHABET PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT\nThis Alphabet Performance Stock Unit Agreement (this “Agreement”) is entered into as of [ ] (the\n“Grant Date”) by and between [PARTICIPANT NAME] (the “Participant”) and Alphabet Inc., a Delaware\ncorporation (“Alphabet”, and together with its Subsidiaries, the “Company”).\nI.\nGRANTS\nPursuant to the Alphabet Inc. 2021 Stock Plan (the “Plan”), Alphabet hereby awards grants of\nperformance stock units (“PSUs,” and each grant of PSUs, a “Grant”) with Target Awards and Performance\nPeriods as set forth in the table below.\nTarget Award\nPerformance Period\nXXXX PSUs\nXXXXXXX\nEach PSU represents the right to receive one share of Capital Stock, subject to the terms and\nconditions of the Plan and this Agreement. The number of PSUs earned under each Grant may be equal to,\ngreater than or less than its Target Award (including zero). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined\nin this Agreement shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Plan.\nII.\nTERMS OF PSUs\n1.\nVesting of PSUs.\n(a)\nIn General. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b) and (c) below, the number\nof PSUs (if any) earned by the Participant under each Grant based on Alphabet’s performance against the\nPerformance Goals (as defined in Exhibit A) during the applicable Performance Period as determined by the\nCommittee in accordance with Exhibit A (each, a “Final Award”) will vest on the Determination Date (as\ndefined in Exhibit A) for such Grant, subject to the Participant’s continued employment with, or service to,\nthe Company through such date, and be settled in accordance with Section II.2 below, and any unvested PSUs\nwill be forfeited as of the Determination Date and the Participant will have no further rights to such unvested\nPSUs. In the event the Participant ceases to be employed by, or ceases to provide services to, the Company\nprior to the Determination Date for a Grant for any reason other than (i) death (as set forth in subsection (b)\nbelow) or (ii) termination by the Company without Cause (as set forth in subsection (c) below), all of the then\noutstanding and unvested PSUs granted under this Agreement will be forfeited effective as of the date that the\nParticipant ceases to be employed by, or ceases to provide services to, the Company (the “Termination\nDate”) and the Participant will have no further rights to such unvested PSUs. Prior to any actual delivery of\nshares of Capital Stock pursuant to the PSUs, the PSUs represent an unfunded, unsecured obligation of the\nCompany, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.\n(b)\nDeath of the Participant. In the event that the Participant ceases to be employed by, or\nceases to provide services to, the Company as a result of the Participant’s death (i)(x) prior to the start of the\nPerformance Period of a Grant or during the Performance Period of\n\na Grant, then the Target Award in respect of such Grant shall immediately vest as of the Termination Date or\n(y) following the end of the Performance Period of a Grant but prior to its Determination Date, then the Final\nAward (as determined by the Committee in accordance with Exhibit A) in respect of such Grant shall\nimmediately vest as of such Determination Date and (ii) any delivery of shares of Capital Stock to be made to\nthe Participant under this Agreement will be made, subject to satisfaction of all applicable Tax-Related Items,\nas described in Section II.4 below, to the Participant’s designated beneficiary; provided, that, such beneficiary\nhas been designated prior to the Participant’s death; in the absence of any such effective designation, the\nshares will be delivered to the administrator or executor of the Participant’s estate. Any such administrator or\nexecutor must furnish Alphabet with (A) written notice of his or her status as transferee, (B) a copy of the\nwill and/or such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the transfer, and\n(C) an agreement by the transferee to comply with all the terms and conditions of PSUs that are or would be\napplicable to the Participant and to be bound by the acknowledgments made by the Participant hereunder.\nDelivery of the shares of Capital Stock in respect of PSUs vesting pursuant to this Section II.1(b) will be\nmade as soon as practicable following the Termination Date or the Determination Date, as applicable, but in\nno event later than forty-five (45) days following such date and the Company shall have no further\nobligations under this Agreement.\n(c)\nTermination of the Participant without Cause. In the event that the Participant ceases to\nbe employed by, or ceases to provide services to, the Company as a result of the Company’s termination of\nthe Participant’s employment or services without Cause prior to the Determination Date for a Grant, then the\nnumber of PSUs (if any) calculated by multiplying the Final Award (as determined by the Committee in\naccordance with Exhibit A) in respect of such Grant by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of\ncalendar days during the Performance Period during which the Participant was employed by, or providing\nservices to, the Company and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of calendar days in the\nPerformance Period, will vest and be settled in accordance with Section II.2 below and any unvested PSUs\nwill be forfeited as of the Determination Date and the Participant will have no further rights to such unvested\nPSUs; provided, that if the Termination Date occurs prior to the start of the Performance Period of a Grant, all\nPSUs under the Grant will be immediately forfeited as of the Termination Date and the Participant will have\nno further rights to such PSUs.\nFor purposes of this Agreement, “Cause” means any of the following: (i) a willful failure by\nParticipant, in the good faith judgment of the Board, to substantially perform the duties associated and\nconsistent with the scope of the Participant’s position; (ii) the Participant’s refusal to implement or follow a\nlawful directive from the Board or CEO; (iii) the Participant’s breach of fiduciary duty to the Company; (iv)\nthe Participant’s material breach of any written agreement between the Participant and the Company,\nincluding, without limitation, any applicable At-Will Employment, Confidential Information and Invention\nAssignment Agreement; (v) the Participant's intentional engagement in conduct that is materially injurious to\nthe Company (economically or reputationally), including but not limited to, misappropriation of trade secrets\nor any other tangible or intangible property of the Company, fraud or embezzlement, but excluding any\nconduct by Participant that is consistent with or pursuant to a lawful directive of the Board or CEO; (vi) the\nParticipant's material violation of a material provision of the Code of Conduct or any policy of Alphabet,\nGoogle LLC or any other affiliate of Alphabet that is applicable to the Participant (e.g., policy against sexual\nharassment, Alphabet's Policy Against Insider Trading (the \"Trading Policy\"), etc.); (vii) the Participant's\nmaterial violation of any federal or state law or regulation applicable to the business of the Company; (viii)\nthe Participant's violation of any securities laws, rules or regulations, or the rules and regulations of any\nsecurities exchange or association of which the Company is a member, failure to cooperate with the Company\nin any investigation or formal proceeding or being found liable in a Securities\n2\n\nand Exchange Commission enforcement action or otherwise being disqualified from serving in the\nParticipant’s position; (ix) the Participant’s engaging in gross misconduct; (x) a substantiated finding by the\nCompany (or its delegate) of sexual harassment, sexual misconduct or retaliation; (xi) the Participant being\nunder investigation for sexual harassment, sexual misconduct or retaliation; or (xii) the Participant’s\ncommission of a felony under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or any comparably-classified\ncrime under the laws of a non-US jurisdiction or other serious crime involving moral turpitude.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, termination of the Participant's employment or service under (i), (ii), (iii), (iv)\nor (vi) (only) above will not be for “Cause” unless the Company determines in its sole discretion that the\nconduct alleged to constitute “Cause” is susceptible of cure or remedy; and, if so, the Participant: (a) is\nprovided with written notice setting forth with specificity the conduct alleged to constitute “Cause,” (b) is\nprovided not less than 30 days following such notice (the “Cure Period”) to cure or remedy such conduct\nprior to the effective date of the Participant's termination of employment or services, during which period the\nParticipant shall be provided the opportunity at the Participant’s election to address the Board with respect to\nsuch conduct (with the assistance of legal counsel, if requested) and (c) fails to cure or remedy such conduct\nduring the Cure Period.\n2.\nSettlement of PSUs. Settlement of vested PSUs in respect of a Grant shall occur as soon as\npracticable following the applicable Determination Date, but in no event later than forty-five (45) days\nfollowing such Determination Date, and the Company shall have no further obligations under such Grant.\nAlphabet will settle vested PSUs by issuing (either in book-entry form or otherwise) to the Participant (or the\nParticipant’s beneficiary or estate, in the event of the Participant’s death), one share of Capital Stock for each\nvested PSU, subject to satisfaction of all applicable Tax-Related Items, as described in Section II.4 below.\n3.\nAdjustment Upon Certain Changes. In the event of any transaction or other event described in\nSection 9 of the Plan, each Grant shall be treated the same way as all other restricted stock units issued under\nthe Plan held by the executive officers of Alphabet in office at the time of such event; provided, that in\naddition to any actions taken by the Committee in respect of such awards pursuant to Sections 9(c) and (d) of\nthe Plan, to the extent determined by the Committee to be necessary and appropriate in its sole discretion, the\nnumber of PSUs subject to each Grant will be fixed at its Target Award.\n4.\nTaxes.\n(a)\nLiability for Tax-Related Items. The Participant acknowledges that the Participant is\nultimately liable and responsible for any and all income taxes (including federal, state and local income\ntaxes), payroll taxes and other tax-related withholding (the “Tax-Related Items”) arising in connection with\nPSUs, regardless of any action the Company takes with respect to such Tax-Related Items. The Participant\nfurther acknowledges that the Company (i) does not make any representation or undertaking regarding the\ntreatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of PSUs, including the grant, vesting and\nsettlement of PSUs under any Grant, or the subsequent sale of shares of Capital Stock acquired upon\nsettlement of any PSUs and (ii) does not commit, and is under no obligation, to structure the terms of PSUs or\nany aspect of PSUs under any Grant to reduce or eliminate the Participant’s liability for Tax-Related Items or\nachieve any particular tax result.\n(b)\nPayment of Withholding Taxes. Alphabet shall, pursuant to such procedures as the\nCommittee may specify from time to time, withhold a number of shares of Capital Stock otherwise issuable\nupon settlement of any vested PSUs having an aggregate Fair Market Value sufficient to satisfy the federal,\nstate and local withholding tax requirements attributable to vested PSUs but not greater than the withholding\nobligations, as determined by the\n3\n\nCommittee in its discretion; provided, that, the Committee hereby reserves the discretion to amend this\nAgreement by notice to the Participant and without obtaining the Participant’s consent, to allow the\nCommittee to use any one or more methods permitted by the Plan to satisfy the federal, state and local\nwithholding tax requirements attributable to the PSUs being settled.\n5.\nRights as Stockholder. Neither the Participant nor any person claiming under or through the\nParticipant will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of Alphabet in respect of any shares of\nCapital Stock deliverable pursuant to PSUs unless and until such shares of Capital Stock have been issued on\nthe records of Alphabet or its transfer agents or registrars. After such issuance, the Participant will have all\nthe rights as a stockholder of Alphabet with respect to such shares of Capital Stock.\n        Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any dividend or other distribution is declared and paid\non shares of Capital Stock after the Grant Date, but prior to the complete settlement, cancellation or forfeiture\nof any PSUs under a Grant, the Participant shall be entitled to receive, upon settlement of any Grant, an\namount equal to the dividends or other distributions that would have been paid or issued on the number of\nshares of Capital Stock actually vested and issuable to Participant pursuant to such Grant had they been\noutstanding during such period, as calculated by the Committee in its discretion.

It led us to be a pioneer in the development of AI and, since 2016, \nan AI-first company. We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO, Sundar Pichai.\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, \nGoogle Services and Google Cloud, and all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Supporting these \nbusinesses, we have centralized certain AI-related research and development which is reported in Alphabet-level \nactivities. Alphabet's structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and \nindependence. \nAccess and Technology for Everyone\nThe Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people, and businesses large and \nsmall. Our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant \ntoday as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find \nanswers to a company that also helps people get things done. \nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools \nthey need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information \nand make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year. \nYouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new and helps support \nthe creator economy through the YouTube Partner Program. Google Cloud helps customers solve today’s business \nchallenges, improve productivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and \nbuilding new products and features to help our users, partners, customers, and communities and have invested more \nthan $150 billion in research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n4.  \n\nMaking AI Helpful for Everyone\nWe believe AI is a profound platform shift, one that can bring meaningful and positive change to people and \nsocieties across the world, and to our business. At Google, we have been bringing AI into our products and services for \nmore than a decade and making them available to our users. \n In 2023, we took a significant step on our journey to make AI more helpful for everyone with the introduction of \nGemini, our natively multimodal AI model. In 2024, we launched Gemini 2.0, our most capable model yet. Gemini can \ngeneralize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information including text, code, \naudio, image, and video. Gemini is powering AI features across our products and services that are helping people \neveryday. Today, all seven of our two billion-user products — Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Play Store, Search, and \nYouTube — are using Gemini.\nOur Google Cloud products, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, help organizations stay at \nthe forefront of innovation with our AI-optimized infrastructure, AI development platform, world-class models, as well as \nassistive agents and applications.\nWe believe AI has the potential to solve important societal, scientific, and engineering challenges. For example, in \n2020, Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge, and in 2024, we \nintroduced AlphaFold 3, built on the previous models, to predict the structure and interactions of all the molecules in \nlife's processes. \nWe are focused on transforming our products to provide the most helpful tools to our users and customers as we \ndeliver on our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. \nDeliver the Most Advanced, Safe, and Responsible AI\nWe aim to build the most advanced, safe, and responsible AI through a full stack of robust AI-optimized \ninfrastructure, including data centers, chips, and a global fiber network; world class research teams; and a broad global \nreach through products and platforms that touch billions of people and customers around the world.\nWe are driving efficiencies in our data centers, while making significant hardware and model improvements. For \nexample, since we started serving AI Overviews to our users, we have significantly lowered machine costs and latency \nthrough hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs. Our AI-optimized infrastructure allows us to use, and \noffer our customers, a range of AI accelerator options, including our own custom-built Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). \nOur teams across Alphabet leverage Gemini, as well as other AI models we have previously developed and \nannounced, to deliver the best product and service experiences for our users, advertisers, partners, customers, and \ndevelopers. We are using Gemini 2.0 in new research prototypes, including Project Astra, which explores the future \ncapabilities of a universal AI assistant and Project Mariner, an early prototype capable of taking actions in Chrome as \nan experimental extension.\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means developing AI in a way that \nmaximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing its potential challenges, guided by our AI Principles. \nEnable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud\nAI is a major technology shift for enterprises. Globally, businesses from startups to large enterprises, and the \npublic sector are thinking about how to drive transformation. That is why we are focused on making it easy and \nscalable for others to innovate, and grow, with AI. That means providing advanced computing infrastructure and \nexpanding access to Google’s latest AI models. Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train, tune, \naugment, test, and deploy applications using Gemini, Imagen, Veo, and other generative AI models. Gemini for Google \nCloud provides pre-packaged AI agents that can assist developers to write, document, test, and operate software as \nwell as assist cybersecurity teams to analyze, detect, protect, and respond to threats.\nImprove Knowledge, Learning, Creativity, and Productivity\nAs AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on transforming our products to provide our users the most \nhelpful tools. Examples include AI Overviews, which allow users to ask their most complex questions, break down \nconcepts in a format that is useful for them, or take a video and ask a question out loud, and NotebookLM, which helps \nusers understand complex information by summarizing sources and providing relevant quotes. We are embedding the \npower of generative AI to continue helping our users express themselves and get things done. For example, the \nGemini app allows users to collaborate with new AI features that include image generation capabilities, coding support, \nand app integration. Gemini for Google Workspace helps users write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and \nhave richer meetings. Additionally, we are using Gemini to improve recommendations on YouTube. We also know \nbusinesses of all sizes around the world rely on Google Ads to find customers and grow their businesses — and we \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n5.  \n\nmake that even easier with AI. For example, advertisers are able to use our updated image generation in Google Ads \nto produce high-quality imagery for their campaigns, and Demand Gen helps them reach their target audiences.\nBuild the Most Helpful Personal Computing Platforms and Devices\nOver the years, our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on \ntop of it. Our latest Pixel devices were built with Gemini Nano, bringing the best AI-assistive experiences to our users, \nsuch as Gemini on Pixel, Pixel Screenshots, and Pixel Studio. Our Android and Chrome operating systems enable \nusers to access Gemini, and other Google AI features throughout their day. For example, with Circle to Search built \ndirectly into the Android experience, users can search anything they see on their phone using a simple gesture.\nMoonshots\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This \nincrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not \nevolutionary. Our acquisitions of YouTube and Android and subsequent launch of Chrome have matured into major \nplatforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. In Other Bets, our fully autonomous driving \ntechnology company, Waymo, is now providing fully autonomous, paid ride-hailing services to customers in multiple \ncities.\nOur early investments in AI started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central \nto future developments. We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term, most notably for the \napplication of AI to our products and services, as well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing. As \nwe said in the original founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as \nthey are the key to our long-term success.\nPrivacy and Security\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are \nnear-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default; \nstrictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that \nput people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete \ntheir data, applying privacy technologies like on-device processing, giving people tools to control their experience, or \nadvancing anti-malware, anti-phishing, and password security features.\nGoogle\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\nGoogle Services\nServing Our Users\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people \nworldwide. Our product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most \nrecognized in the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Gmail, \nGoogle Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by \nusers around the world.\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than 25 years ago. \nWhile Google Search started as a way to find web pages, organized into ten blue links, we have driven technical \nadvancements and product innovations that have transformed Google Search into a dynamic, multimodal experience. \nWe first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search, making it easier to navigate on smaller \nscreens. As new types of content surfaced on the internet, Universal Search made it possible to search multiple \ncontent types, like news, images, videos, and more, to deliver rich, relevant results. The introduction of new search \nmodalities, like voice and visual search, made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive \nways. We took that a step further with multisearch, which lets people search with text and images at the same time. \nLarge language models have made it possible to express more natural language queries, vastly improving the types of \nquestions users can ask, and the quality of results. Each advancement has made it easier and more natural for people \nto find what they are looking for. We are now using Gemini customized for Google Search to provide our users an \nimproved Search experience, and AI Overviews has been released in more than one hundred countries, reaching more \nthan one billion users.\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery \nand creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are \nconsuming many forms of digital content, including watching videos, streaming TV, playing games, listening to music, \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n6.  \n\nreading books, and using apps. Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people \naround the world to create and find great digital content.\nFueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and devices. That is why we continue to \ninvest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as well \nas our family of devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people's lives easier by \ncombining the best of our AI, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices, \nsuch as the new Pixel 9 series and the Pixel Watch 3. Creating products and services that people rely on every day is \na journey that we are investing in for the long-term.\nHow We Make Money\nWe have built world-class advertising technologies for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital \nmarketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide \nrange of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads \nat the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. AI has been foundational to our \nadvertising business for more than a decade. Products like Demand Gen, Performance Max, and Product Studio use \nthe full power of our AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities.\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears \non Google Search & other properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners' properties (\"Google Network \nproperties\"). We continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of \nadvertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\n•\nPerformance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct \nengagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving \nmeasurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n•\nBrand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity for advertisers' products and services, \nthrough videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand \nadvertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing \ncampaigns. \nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. \nWe focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering \nout invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and \nvideos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\nIn addition, Google Services increasingly generates revenues from products and services beyond advertising, \nincluding:\n•\nconsumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, \nYouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\n•\nplatforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases; and\n•\ndevices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices.\nGoogle Cloud\nThrough our Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace offerings, Google Cloud generates revenues \nprimarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, applications, and other cloud \nservices. Customers use Google Cloud in multiple ways such as:\n•\nAI-optimized Infrastructure: provides open, reliable, and scalable compute, networking, and storage to \nenable customers to run workloads anywhere — on our Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. It can be \nused to migrate and modernize IT systems and to train and serve various types of AI models. \n•\nDeveloper Platform: provides developers, through the Vertex AI platform, the ability to train, tune, augment, \ntest, and deploy applications using Gemini and other leading generative AI models. We offer widely used first-\nparty, third-party, and open models along with services such as vector search, grounding, and distillation to \nfurther improve the cost and quality of models.\n•\nCybersecurity: provides AI powered cybersecurity solutions to help customers analyze, detect, protect, and \nrespond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats, to further strengthen security outcomes, prioritize which \nthreats to investigate, and identify attack paths, as well as accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n7.  \n\n•\nData and Analytics: provides a variety of different types of databases — relational, key-value, and in-memory \n— to store and manage data for different types of applications and deliver data to AI agents. Our data platform \nalso unifies data lakes, data warehouses, data governance, and advanced machine learning into a single \nplatform that helps users analyze data using AI models across any cloud.\n•\nApplications: offers a broad applications portfolio, including Gemini for Google Cloud and Gemini for Google \nWorkspace, as well as purpose-built agents for Search and our Customer Engagement Suite. AI has been \nused in Google Workspace for years to improve grammar, efficiency, security, and more with features like \nSmart Reply, Smart Compose, and malware and phishing protection in Gmail. Now, Gemini for Google \nWorkspace brings our AI-powered agents into Gmail, Docs, Sheets and more to help users write, organize, \nvisualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings.\nOther Bets\n Across Alphabet, we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries, \nincluding transportation and health technology. Alphabet’s investment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses \nthat are at various stages of development, ranging from those in the R&D phase to those that are in the beginning \nstages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as \nindependent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. \nWhile these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating \nrevenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the \nsale of healthcare-related services, and internet services.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable \ncompetition in every aspect of our business, including but not limited to, from:\n•\ngeneral purpose search engines and information services;\n•\nvertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries on topics such as those related to travel, jobs, \nand health, which users may navigate directly to rather than go through Google;\n•\nonline advertising platforms and networks, including online shopping and streaming services;\n•\nother forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers \ntypically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline;\n•\ndigital content and application platform providers;\n•\nproviders of enterprise cloud services;\n•\ndevelopers and providers of AI products and services;\n•\ncompanies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that \nhave developed proprietary platforms;\n•\nproviders of digital video services; \n•\nsocial networks, which users may rely on for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information \nthrough traditional search engines;\n•\nproviders of workspace communication and connectivity products; and \n•\ndigital assistant providers.\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and \ntechnologies to the marketplace across our businesses. For example, for advertising, competing successfully depends \non attracting and retaining:\n•\nusers, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance \nof our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n•\nadvertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver \ntheir advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n•\ncontent providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners \ngenerate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n8.  \n\nFor additional information about competition, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nOngoing Commitment to Sustainability\nOur environmental strategy has two key pillars, supported by our dedication to accessible information and \ntechnological innovation:\n•\nOur products: We are empowering people with information about the environmental impacts of their choices.\n•\nOur operations: We are working to drive sustainability and efficiency across our operations and value chain.\nThrough our products, we have an aspiration to help individuals, cities, and other partners collectively reduce one \ngigaton of their carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030. \nIn 2021, we set an ambitious goal to reach net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain by \n2030. To make progress toward this effort, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), \nand Scope 3 absolute emissions (compared to our 2019 base year) by 2030, and we plan to invest in nature-based \nand technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions.\nOur primary approach to reducing our Scope 2 emissions is through the procurement of carbon-free energy \n(CFE). In 2020, we set a goal to run on 24/7 CFE every hour of every day on every grid where we operate by 2030. In \n2023, we began implementing our carbon removals strategy, and we have begun establishing impactful partnerships \nand have started contracting for carbon removal credits.\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals. We also know that our path \nto net-zero emissions will not be easy or linear. Some of our plans may take years to deliver results, particularly where \nthey involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. Our approach will continue to evolve and will \nrequire us to navigate significant uncertainty, including the uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, \nwhich is complex and difficult to predict. In addition, solutions for some key global challenges do not currently exist, \nand will depend heavily on the development and improvement of new technologies by us and by the energy sector. As \nour business and industry continue to evolve, we expect our total GHG emissions to rise before dropping toward our \nabsolute emissions reduction target.\nFor additional information about risks and uncertainties applicable to our work on sustainability and efficiency, see \nItem 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCulture and Workforce\nWe are a company of curious, talented, and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and \nencourage the iteration of ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society.\nOur people are critical for our continued success, so we work hard to create an environment where employees \ncan have fulfilling careers, and be happy, healthy, and perform at a high level. We offer industry-leading benefits and \nprograms to take care of the diverse needs of our employees and their families, including opportunities for career \ngrowth and development, resources to support their financial health, and access to excellent healthcare choices. Our \ncompetitive compensation programs help us to attract and retain key talent, and we will continue to invest in recruiting \ntalented people to technical and non-technical roles, and rewarding them well. We provide a variety of high quality \ntraining and support to managers to build and strengthen their capabilities-–ranging from courses for new managers, to \nlearning resources that help them provide feedback and manage performance, to coaching and individual support.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Alphabet had 183,323 employees. We have work councils and statutory employee \nrepresentation obligations in certain countries, and we are committed to supporting protected labor rights, maintaining \nan open culture, and listening to all employees. Supporting healthy and open dialogue is central to how we work, and \nwe communicate information about the company through multiple internal channels to our employees.\nWhen appropriate we partner with outside companies on a contractual basis to provide a specialized service or to \ntemporarily cover a short-term need. The employees of our suppliers and staffing partners — vendors and temporary \nstaff, respectively — and independent contractors who are self-employed, make up our extended workforce. We \nchoose our partners and staffing agencies carefully, and review their compliance with Google’s Supplier Code of \nConduct.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to numerous United States (U.S.) federal, state, and local, as well as foreign laws and regulations \ncovering a wide variety of subjects, and the scope of this coverage continues to broaden with continuing new legal and \nregulatory developments in the U.S. and internationally. Like other companies in the technology industry, we face \nincreasingly heightened scrutiny from both U.S. and foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n9.  \n\nregulations. Many of these laws and regulations are evolving and their applicability and scope, as interpreted by the \ncourts, remain uncertain. Particularly with regard to AI; competition; consumer protection; content moderation; data \nprivacy and security; news publications; and sustainability and other social matters, we have seen an increase in new \nand evolving laws and regulations, as well as related enforcement actions and investigations, being proposed and \nimplemented in recent years by legislative and regulatory bodies around the world. As we have seen in recent years, \ndifferent laws and regulations on the same topic may not always have the same requirements, and even when \nrequirements overlap, the rules are not always consistently implemented, interpreted, and enforced from jurisdiction to \njurisdiction.\nOur compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could, individually or in the aggregate, \nincrease our cost of doing business, make our products and services less useful, limit our ability to pursue certain \nbusiness practices or offer certain products and services, cause us to change our business models and operations, \naffect our competitive position relative to our peers, and/or otherwise harm our business, reputation, financial condition, \nand operating results.\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Item 1A Risk Factors; \nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect in Part II, Item 7; and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to \nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our \nproprietary technology and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international \ntrademarks, service marks, domain names, and copyrights. We have also filed patent applications in the U.S. and \nforeign countries covering certain of our technology, and acquired patent assets to supplement our portfolio. We have \nlicensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our rights to other parties. For additional \ninformation, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAvailable Information\nOur website is located at www.abc.xyz, and our investor relations website is located at www.abc.xyz/investor. \nAccess to our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and our \nProxy Statements, and any amendments to these reports, is available on our investor relations website, free of charge, \nafter we file or furnish them with the SEC and they are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\nWe webcast via our investor relations YouTube channel and website our earnings calls and certain events we \nparticipate in or host with members of the investment community. Our investor relations website also provides \nnotifications of news or announcements regarding our financial performance and other items that may be material or of \ninterest to our investors, including SEC filings, investor events, press and earnings releases, and blogs. We also share \nGoogle news and product updates on Google's Keyword blog at https://www.blog.google/ and News From Google \npage on X at x.com/NewsFromGoogle, and our executive officers may also use certain social media channels, such as \nX and LinkedIn, to communicate information about earnings results and company updates, which may be of interest or \nmaterial to our investors. Further, corporate governance information, including our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, \ngovernance guidelines, board committee charters, and code of conduct, is also available on our investor relations \nwebsite under the heading \"Governance.\" The information contained on, or that may be accessed through our \nwebsites or our executive officers' social media channels, is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on \nForm 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our websites are intended to \nbe inactive textual references only.\nITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to \nthose described below, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and affect \nthe trading price of our Class A and Class C stock.\nRisks Specific to our Company\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, a \nloss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to personalize \nads could harm our business.\nWe generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2024. Many of our advertisers, \ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their \ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value \n(such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n10.  \n\nmonetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, such as \nour initiatives related to third-party cookies, including our announcement in July 2024 to move from phasing out all \nthird-party cookies to a proposed user choice model (which remains subject to continuing discussions with regulators), \nas well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may in the \nfuture, affect the advertising services that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that \nmake personalized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services \nhave integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital \nadvertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our \nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse \nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in \nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and \noperating results.\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that \nare useful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our \nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results. \nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing \ntechnologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, \nwe must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, \nand technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a \nwider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in technical infrastructure and \nR&D, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology, products, and services. \nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international \ncompetitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer \noperating histories and well-established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources \nin ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions and entering into other strategic \narrangements; continuing to invest heavily in technical infrastructure, R&D, and in talent; initiating intellectual property \nand competition claims (whether or not meritorious); and continuing to compete for users, advertisers, customers, and \ncontent providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to \naggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our \ncompetitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster or more cost effectively than we \ncan or may foresee the need for products and services before we do. \nWe are expanding our investment in AI across the entire company. This includes generative AI and continuing to \nintegrate AI capabilities into our products and services. AI technology and services are highly competitive, rapidly \nevolving, and require significant investment, including technical infrastructure, development and operational costs, to \nmeet the changing needs and expectations of our existing users and attract new users. Our ability to deploy certain AI \ntechnologies critical for our products and services and for our business strategy may depend on the availability and \npricing of third-party equipment and other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, \nand equipment costs. Additionally, other companies may develop AI products and technologies that are similar or \nsuperior to our technologies or more cost-effective to develop and/or deploy. Other companies may also have (or in the \nfuture may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, \nor sell our own AI products and services.\nOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive in a \ntimely manner to the evolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content \nproviders, or if we miscalculate those needs and desires and invest significantly in areas that fail to gain sufficient \nmarket traction. As new and existing technologies continue to develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to \noffer experiences that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. These technologies \ncould reduce usage of our products and services, and force us to compete in different ways and expend significant \nresources to develop and operate equal or better products and services. Competitors’ success in providing compelling \nproducts and services or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers \ncould harm our financial condition and operating results. \nOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and \ncould divert management attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies in a \nwide range of industries beyond online advertising. The investments that we are making across our businesses, such \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n11.  \n\nas building AI capabilities into new and existing products and services, reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and \nprovide products and services that are helpful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our \ninvestments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in \npursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities. \nWe have invested significantly and expect to continue to invest significantly in our property and equipment, \nincluding our technical infrastructure, and we expect these assets to benefit our business over their estimated useful \nlives. Changes in facts and circumstances such as changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned \nuse and utilization of assets, and/or technological advancements, could indicate a change in the period over which we \nexpect to benefit from the asset and impact our financial condition and operating results.\nInnovations in our products and services could also result in changes to user behavior and affect our revenue \ntrends. These endeavors involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of resources and management \nattention from current operations, different monetization models, and the use of alternative investment, governance, or \ncompensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their \nobjectives.\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in devices, including our smartphones, home devices, and \nwearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid \nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, increased market saturation in developed countries, short \nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in performance characteristics, and price and \nfeature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide \ndevices that compete effectively. \nWithin Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, \nincluding Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, and we are advancing our AI platforms and models to \nsupport these tools and technologies. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud \ncomputing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales force. At the \nsame time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing, including platform \nswitching costs, are challenging across the industry, and delivery models are competitive and constantly evolving, and \nwe may therefore not achieve our business objectives. Further, our business with financial services, healthcare, and \npublic sector customers may present additional risks, including regulatory compliance risks. For instance, we may be \nsubject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply or any deficiencies found may expose us to \nlegal, financial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations may require us to make new capital \ninvestments, build new products, and seek partners to deliver localized services in other countries, and we may not be \nable to meet sovereign operating requirements. \nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in areas such as health, life sciences, and transportation, among \nothers. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and \nour offerings, many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be \nable to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability. \nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, raise ethical, technological, \nlegal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and \nservices. Because all of these investment areas are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies \nand offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we may experience downward pressure on our \noperating margin in the future. \nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the \ndevices and modalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines \nin advertiser spending; competition; changes in customer usage and demand for our existing products and increasing \ndemand for new technologies; decreases in the pricing of our products and services; ongoing product and policy \nchanges; and shifts to lower priced products and services. \nIn addition, we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors, \nsuch as an increase in the mix of lower-margin products and services, in particular from the continued expansion of our \nbusiness into new fields, including products and services such as our devices, Google Cloud, and consumer \nsubscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those \nwe generate from advertising. In particular, margins on our devices have had, and may continue to have, an adverse \neffect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. We may also experience \ndownward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increasing costs \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n12.  \n\nfor many aspects of our business, including higher level of investment in technical infrastructure. Further, certain of our \ncosts and expenses are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. We may also \nnot be able to continue to execute our efficiency efforts successfully or in a timely manner. Due to these factors and the \nevolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be \nindicative of our future performance. For additional information, see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect and \nRevenues and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of \nour products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete. \nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for \nus. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, \nservices, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country \nin which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have \ntaken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection \nfor our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have \nadequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the \npossibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or \nunenforceable. \nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and \nother sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting \nfrom these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word \n“Google” could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” Some courts have \nruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S., \nmay reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in \nother people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand. \nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. \nAlso, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of \nour intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating \nresults. \nOur business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our \nability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. \nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the \nbrands within Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch \nnew and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content \nproviders, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of \nfactors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and \nsecurity issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to respond \nappropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable \npractices by advertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our \nbrands. \nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, \nand operating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to \nprovide high-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a \nrange of settings. \nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial \ncondition, and operating results. \nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability \nto supply both our products and our services. \nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our devices as well as servers and networking \nequipment used in our technical infrastructure, certain components of which we may supply. We rely on third parties to \nsupply components and distribute our products and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not \nable to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we \nengage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes \nin the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them. \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n13.  \n\nWe have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages, price increases, quality issues, and/\nor longer lead times that could negatively affect our operations, driven by raw material and/or component availability, \nmanufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, logistics capacity, inflation, foreign currency exchange \nrates, tariffs, sanctions and export controls, trade disputes and barriers, forced labor concerns, sustainability sourcing \nrequirements, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters or pandemics, the effects of climate change \n(such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns \nassociated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power and transmission availability, and significant \nchanges in the financial or business condition of our suppliers. Some of the components we use in our technical \ninfrastructure and our devices are available from only one or limited sources, and we may not be able to find \nreplacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. A significant supply interruption that \naffects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay consumer product \navailability. \nWe may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and \nconditions. We may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological \nchange, changed consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of \nour hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of sales \nof our devices decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing \ncosts or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our \nfinancial condition and operating results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable \ncontractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and \nmay affect our supply. For example, industry supply capacity for AI accelerators, including Graphics Processing Units, \nor GPUs, as well as our custom-built TPUs, is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. If we are unable to negotiate \nfavorable contractual terms or our competitors claim the supply or capacity first, we may face supply constraints.\nOur devices have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, or \noperations. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or \nsuppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are \ndefective or require a recall, it could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nWe require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies \nand practices, such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data \nsecurity, environmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. \nViolations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key \nrelationships, and damage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property \ncould affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims. \nInterruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications \nsystems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our \nreputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nThe availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing \noperation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage, \ninterference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters \nor pandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, export controls and sanctions, the effects of climate change \n(such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns \nassociated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power and transmission availability challenges, \nutility outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, software bugs, cyber attacks, supply-chain attacks, \ncomputer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our \ndata centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are \nalso subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions \nresulting from problems experienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts \nhappening in the area. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for \nall eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic, closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems \naffecting our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are \nhighly technical and complex and have contained in the past, and may contain in the future, errors or vulnerabilities, \nwhich could result in interruptions in or failure of our services or systems. Any of these incidents could impede or \nprevent us from effectively offering products and providing services, which could harm our business, reputation, \nfinancial condition, and operating results. \nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, reputation, \nfinancial condition, and operating results.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n14.  \n\nOur international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow \ninternationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 51% of our consolidated revenues in 2024. In \naddition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the \nfollowing:\n•\nrestrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent \nus from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;\n•\nsanctions, import and export controls, other market access barriers, political unrest, geopolitical tensions, \nchanges in regimes, or armed conflict (such as ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine), any of which \nmay affect our business continuity, increase our operating costs, limit demand for our products and services, \nlimit our ability to source components or final products, or prevent or impede us from operating in certain \njurisdictions, complying with local laws, or offering products or services;\n•\nlonger payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;\n•\nan evolving foreign policy landscape that could harm our revenues and could subject us to litigation, new \nregulatory costs and challenges (including new customer requirements), uncertainty regarding regulatory \noutcomes, and other liabilities under local laws that may not offer due process or clear legal precedent;\n•\nanti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain \npayments to government officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties; and\n•\ndifferent employee/employer relationships; different labor laws, regulations, and labor practices; and other \nchallenges caused by distance, language, local expertise, and cultural differences, increasing the complexity \nof doing business in multiple jurisdictions.\nBecause we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, \nwe have faced, and will continue to face, exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we \nhedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. \ndollar and foreign currencies have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our revenues and earnings. \nHedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial \ncondition and operating results. \nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial \nstatements incorporate inherently subjective valuation methodologies. \nThe fair value of our debt and equity investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the \npast, negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying \nentities, foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market \nin general, or other factors. \nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-\nbased compensation awards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in \na business combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, which is inherently subjective and requires management \njudgment and estimation. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&E, which \nincreases the volatility of our OI&E. The unrealized gains and losses or impairments we record from fair value \nremeasurements in any particular period may differ significantly from the gains and losses we ultimately realize on \nsuch investments.\nAs a result of these factors, the value of our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition \nand operating results. \nRisks Related to our Industry \nPeople access our products and services through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to \nevolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely \nadopt versions of our products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed. \nPeople access our products and services through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, \nphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables (including virtual reality and \naugmented reality devices), automobiles, and television-streaming devices. Our products and services may be less \npopular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, \nand our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited functionality for our users or \nour advertisers on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their \ndevices. \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n15.  \n\nIt is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing \ncompetitive new products and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and \nsupporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices. Failing to attract and retain a substantial \nnumber of device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users, or failing to develop products and \ntechnologies that work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating \nresults and ability to capture future business opportunities. \nIssues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm and increased liability exposure. \nOur evolving AI-related efforts may give rise to risks related to harmful content, inaccuracies, discrimination, \nintellectual property infringement or misappropriation, violation of rights of publicity, defamation, data privacy, \ncybersecurity, and other issues. As a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our \nimplementation of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability (including under \nnew and proposed legislation and regulations), new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual \nproperty, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm. \nSome uses of AI will present ethical issues and may have broad effects on society. In order to implement AI \nresponsibly and minimize unintended harmful effects, we have already devoted and will continue to invest significant \nresources to develop, test, and maintain our products and services, but we may not be able to identify or resolve all AI-\nrelated issues, deficiencies, and/or failures before they arise. Unintended consequences, uses, or customization of our \nAI tools and systems may negatively affect human rights, privacy, employment, or other social concerns, which may \nresult in claims, lawsuits, brand or reputational harm, and increased regulatory scrutiny, any of which could harm our \nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\nData privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our \nreputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from \nusing our products and services. Computer viruses, software bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks \non our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users’ \nand customers’ ability to use our products and services, harming our business and reputation. \nConcerns about, including the adequacy of, our practices with regard to the collection, use, governance, \ndisclosure, or security of personal data or other data-privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our \nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as \nexpectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change. \nOur products and services involve the storage, handling, and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive \ninformation. Malicious software such as viruses, software bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products \nand services, as well as cyber attacks, phishing schemes, and other types of security breaches expose us to a risk of \nloss or improper use and disclosure of such information, which could result in litigation and other potential liabilities, \nincluding regulatory fines and penalties, as well as reputational harm. Additionally, our products incorporate highly \ntechnical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and are likely in the \nfuture to contain, undetected errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities. We continue to add new features involving AI to our \nofferings and internal systems, and features that rely on AI may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats as our \nand the market’s understanding of AI-centric security risks and protection methods continue to develop. We have in the \npast discovered, and may in the future discover, some errors in our software code only after we have released the \ncode. Systems and control failures, security breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent \ndisclosure of user data could result in regulatory and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation, brand, and \nbusiness, and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers. Such incidents have occurred in the past and \nmay continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our products and services. While there is no guarantee that such \nincidents will not cause significant damage, we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security \nprotections that limit the effect of bugs, theft, misuse, and security vulnerabilities or breaches. \nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. \nCyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods \nof time. For example, the development and implementation of AI technologies may further increase our exposure to or \nexacerbate the risks of cyber attacks or other security incidents, particularly where such technologies are exploited by \nthird parties to breach our or other parties’ systems, including when such technologies are used to target our \nemployees or impersonate members of senior management in order to gain unauthorized access to our systems. We \nhave also seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, which could affect our or \nother parties’ systems. We expect to continue to experience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. Our efforts to \nprevent security incidents and address undesirable activity on our platform may require us to spend additional \nresources to prepare and defend against such threats, and could also increase the risk of retaliatory attack. In addition, \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n16.  \n\nwe face the risk of cyber attacks by nation-states and state-sponsored actors. These attacks may target us or our \ncustomers, particularly our public sector customers (including federal, state, and local governments). Geopolitical \ntensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine, may increase these risks. \nWe may experience security and/or privacy issues, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, \nsystem errors, or vulnerabilities in our or other parties’ systems. While we may not determine some of these issues to \nbe material at the time they occur and may remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not \nultimately result in significant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries, enforcement \nactions, litigation, and negative publicity. There is also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be \ndetermined to be material at a later date in the aggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of \ntheir occurrence. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, disable or degrade service provided \nby or otherwise sabotage systems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a \ntarget, even taking all reasonable precautions, including those required by law, we have been unable in the past and \nmay continue to be unable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative \nmeasures. \nFurther, if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data-\nsecurity practices, fail to comply with our terms and policies, or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach, our \nusers’ data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. If an actual or perceived breach of our or our business \npartners’ or service providers’ security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures \nwould be harmed, we could lose users and customers, our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be \ncompromised, and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may \ninclude class-action litigation) and regulatory actions, fines, and penalties. Any of the foregoing consequences could \nharm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nWhile we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including \ndedicated worldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or \npandemic, may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to \nprevent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal, \nreputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nFor additional information, see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under ‘Risks Related \nto Laws, Regulations, and Policies’ below.\nOur ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of \nour platforms and misuse of user data. \nIn addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety, \nsecurity, and review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties, \nincluding investigation and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services. \nAs a result of these efforts, we have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, incidents of unnecessary \naccess to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. However, we may not have discovered, \nand may in the future not discover, all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data limitations, including \nour lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, or other factors, including factors \noutside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic, and we may learn of such incidents or activity via third \nparties. Such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our \nterms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper ad \npurchases, activities that threaten people’s safety on- or off-line, or instances of spamming, scraping, or spreading \ndisinformation. While we may not determine some of these incidents to be material at the time they occurred and we \nmay remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal, financial, \nand reputational harm, including government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. There \nis also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the \naggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. \nWe may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such \nincidents. Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation \nand brands, require us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations, and adversely \naffect our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and \nregulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management’s time and attention, \nand lead to enhanced regulatory oversight. \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n17.  \n\nProblematic content on our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content \nfarms, and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could harm our \nreputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services. \nWe, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms, including \nsophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate \nrevenues, or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent. While we invest \nsignificantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and \ninvalid traffic, we have been unable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuses or promote \nuniformly high-quality content. Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new avenues of \nabuse for bad actors.\nMany websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in \nsearch results than our search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have \naffected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading, \nor undesirable content. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam \nin most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their \nrankings. Although we continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our \nplatforms, there is no guarantee that our technology will always be successful, and our users may have negative \nexperiences on our platforms if our technology fails to work as intended, which may affect our users' decisions in \ncontinuing to use our platforms. We also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, \nincluding content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve \ntheir search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent abuse from \nlow-quality websites, but we may not always be successful. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including \nviolations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference; activities that threaten \nthe safety and/or well-being of our users, including minors, on- or off-line; and the spreading of misinformation or \ndisinformation. \nIf we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality \ncontent, it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our \nfinancial condition and operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in \nmonetary penalties and damages and divert management’s time and attention. \nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet \naccess providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and \nservices, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers. \nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products \nrequire significant network capacity to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have \nsignificant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone \ncompanies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of \nthese providers have taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the \ncost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or \nfacilitate our offerings, by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing our \ncompetitors preferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination \nby internet access providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such \nprotections. In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated \nrestrictions or blockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, \nadvertisers, and/or content providers, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase \ncosts, thereby negatively affecting our business. \nRisks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies \nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could \nharm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue \nto expand our business. \nWe are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state as well as foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety \nof subjects, and our introduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue to subject \nus to additional laws and regulations. In recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a \nlarge number of new laws and regulations relevant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and \nsecurity, competition, AI, and online content. The costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to \nincrease in the future, including as a result of differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations. \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n18.  \n\nNew or changing laws and regulations, or interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a \nmanner inconsistent with our interpretations of such laws and regulations and/or our practices, have resulted in, and \nmay continue to result in, less useful products and services, altered business models and operations, limited ability to \npursue certain business practices or offer certain products and services, substantial costs, and civil or criminal liability. \nExamples include laws and regulations regarding: \n•\nCompetition and technology platforms’ business practices: Laws and regulations focused on large \ntechnology platforms, including the Digital Markets Act in the European Union (EU); regulations and legal \nsettlements in the U.S., South Korea, and elsewhere that affect Google Play’s billing policies, fees, and \nbusiness model; as well as litigation and new and expected regulations in a range of jurisdictions, including, \namong others, in the UK, Japan, and India.\n•\nAI: Laws and regulations focused on the development, use, and provision of AI technologies and other digital \nproducts and services, which could result in monetary penalties or other regulatory actions. For example, the \nEU AI Act came into force on August 1, 2024, and will generally become fully applicable after a two-year \ntransitional period (although certain obligations will take effect at an earlier or later time). The EU AI Act \nintroduces various requirements for AI systems and models placed on the market or put into service in the EU, \nincluding specific transparency and other requirements for general purpose AI systems and the models on \nwhich those systems are based. In the U.S., there is increasing uncertainty as to the federal government's \napproach to AI regulation going forward, as the continued applicability of the White House's 2023 Executive \nOrder on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, which lays out a \nframework for the U.S. government, among other things, to monitor private sector development of certain \nfoundation models, remains subject to regulatory development. Several states are considering enacting or \nhave already enacted regulations concerning the use of AI technologies, including those focused on consumer \nprotection, and depending on the scope of AI regulation at the federal level, some states may move to regulate \nAI model development and deployment. Further, at the federal and state level, there have been various \nproposals (and in some cases laws enacted) addressing “deepfakes” and other AI-generated synthetic media. \n•\nData privacy, collection, processing, and portability: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, \nprocessing, and/or sharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws; laws \naffecting the processing of children's data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws; laws \nlimiting data transfers (including data localization laws); and laws requiring data portability (including the EU \nData Act, as discussed further below). \n•\nCopyright and other intellectual property: Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on \nCopyright in the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which have introduced \nnew licensing regimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our \nplatforms, or create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and \npublishers, which may result in other regulatory actions. \n•\nContent moderation: Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure \nobligations, such as the EU's Digital Services Act, Florida’s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas’ House Bill 20, and \nlaws and proposed legislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure \nto remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and \nalgorithms, which may make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with \nlow-quality, deceptive, or harmful content, or on the other hand, may impinge on the rights of free expression, \nwhich, in turn, could impact how our platforms are viewed by users. Additionally, legislators are increasingly \nfocused on regulating online child safety, including content protections for minors under eighteen years of age. \nThese regulations could result in our having to modify our products and services and incur additional costs to \noperate and monitor minors’ experiences on our products and services.\n•\nConsumer protection: Consumer protection laws, including the EU’s New Deal for Consumers, which could \nresult in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations, as interpreted by courts, \nregulators, or administrative bodies, remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For \nexample, we rely on statutory safe harbors, like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 \nof the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and the Digital Services Act in Europe, to protect against liability for \nvarious linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and hosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe \nharbors may harm us and may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals and pending \nlitigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and \nonline platforms. Our development, use, and commercialization of AI products and services (including our \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n19.  \n\nimplementation of AI in our offerings and internal systems) could subject us to regulatory action and legal liability, \nincluding under specific legislation regulating AI, as well as new applications of existing data protection, cybersecurity, \nprivacy, intellectual property, and other laws.\nFurther, we are subject to evolving laws, regulations, policies, and international accords relating to matters \nbeyond our core products and services, including environmental sustainability, climate change, human capital, and \nemployment matters. In response, we have implemented robust programs, adopted reporting frameworks and \nprinciples, and announced a number of complex and ambitious goals and initiatives that may require considerable \ninvestments. We cannot guarantee that our goals and initiatives will be fully realized on the timelines we expect or at \nall, and projects that are completed as planned may not achieve the results we anticipate.\nWe are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and \ninvestigations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability, \nincluding competition matters, that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating \nresults.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, \nand orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and \nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or \npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), various U.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed, and may continue to file \nin the future, several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business, including our advertising technologies \nand practices, the operation and distribution of Google Search, and the operation and distribution of the Android \noperating system and Play Store.\nFor example, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit alleging that Google violated \nantitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising, and in August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia ruled that Google violated such antitrust laws. The Court is holding a separate proceeding to determine \nremedies, which could include alterations to our products and services and our business models and operations, \nincluding structural remedies, and/or our distribution arrangements, among other changes. While we plan to appeal, \nthere can be no assurance that our appeal will succeed, or that we will be able to change or decrease the severity of \nany remedies that may be ordered, and any or all of these potential remedies could harm our business, reputation, \nfinancial condition, and operating results.\nAlso, in December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated \nantitrust laws relating to Google Play's business. The presiding judge issued a remedies decision in October 2024 that \nordered a variety of alterations to our business models and operations and contractual agreements for Android and \nGoogle Play. We are appealing the verdict, but if we are unsuccessful, we could face significant expenses to \nimplement the remedies, and such costs and alterations could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and \noperating results.\nFurthermore, in December 2020, several State Attorneys General, led by the Texas Attorney General, filed an \nantitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated antitrust and \nother laws relating to its advertising technology. This case is set for trial in March 2025, and we could face significant \ncivil penalties. In January 2023, the DOJ and several Attorneys General sued in the Eastern District of Virginia alleging \nsimilar antitrust violations relating to Google’s advertising technology. Trial in the DOJ matter concluded in September \n2024 with a decision expected in early 2025. If we are unsuccessful, we could face an order on remedies that could \nharm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nIn addition to these regulatory proceedings, private individual and collective actions that overlap with claims \npursued by regulators are pending in the U.S. and in several other jurisdictions. Adverse results in these or similar \nfuture lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages and remedies that could harm our business, reputation, \nfinancial condition, and operating results.\nOther regulatory agencies in the U.S. and around the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection \nagencies, and data protection authorities, have challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and \ncompliance with laws and regulations. We are cooperating with these investigations and defending litigation or \nappealing decisions where appropriate.\nWe are also subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection \nclaims related to product defects, among other litigation, and we may also be subject to claims involving health and \nsafety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental effects, AI training, development, and commercialization, or \nservice disruptions or failures. Claims have been brought, and we expect will continue to be brought, against us for \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n20.  \n\ndefamation, negligence, breaches of contract, patent, copyright and trademark infringement, unfair competition, \nunlawful activity, torts, privacy rights violations, fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature and content of \ninformation available on or via our services, the design and effect of our products and services, or due to our \ninvolvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to content created by third parties.\nVarious laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have involved in the past, \nand may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing \nobligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, including \ndivestiture, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences. Any of these legal proceedings could \nalso result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, and negative publicity, all of which could harm our \nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nEstimating liabilities for our pending proceedings is a complex, fact-specific, and speculative process that requires \nsignificant judgment, and the amounts we are ultimately liable for may be less than or exceed our estimates. The \nresolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, additional substantial fines, \npenalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating \nresults. \nFor additional information about the ongoing material legal proceedings to which we are subject, see Legal \nProceedings in Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPrivacy, data protection, data usage, and portability regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. \nAny failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial \ncondition, and operating results. \nAuthorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals \nconcerning data protection, data usage and portability, and encryption of user data. Additionally, the increasing \nadoption of AI technologies, which rely on the collection of large amounts of data and use of such data for training \npurposes, has led data protection authorities around the world to consider and adopt new and evolving interpretations \nof data protection laws, imposing specific obligations with respect to the processing of personal data, including \nrequired notices, consents, and opt-outs. Further, the increased risk of inadvertent disclosure of confidential \ninformation or personal data in connection with the utilization of AI technologies may result in stronger regulatory \nscrutiny, leading to legal and regulatory investigations and enforcement actions that may negatively affect our \nbusiness, even if unfounded. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation have resulted in, and may continue to \nresult in, fines and orders requiring that we change our practices, which have had and could continue to have an \nadverse effect on how we provide services, harming our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating \nresults. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and compliance obligations could cause \nus to incur substantial costs or harm the quality and operations of our products and services in ways that harm our \nbusiness. Examples of these laws include: \n•\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulations, \nwhich apply to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or the United Kingdom, \nrespectively, or related to products and services that we offer to EU or the United Kingdom users or customers, \nrespectively, or the monitoring of their behavior in the EU or the UK, respectively.\n•\nVarious U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign privacy laws related to the processing and security of personal \ndata, including (1) comprehensive privacy laws that provide data privacy rights (including, in California, a \nprivate right of action in the event of a data breach resulting from our failure to implement and maintain \nreasonable security procedures and practices) and impose significant obligations on controllers and \nprocessors of consumer data; (2) laws imposing obligations on businesses that collect or disclose biometric \ninformation (including, in Illinois, Texas, and Washington); (3) laws governing the collection and processing of \nchildren and minor’s data and how companies provide age appropriate online experiences (including, in the \nU.S., the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, the pending Children and Teens' Online Privacy \nProtection Act (COPPA 2.0), which passed the U.S. Senate in 2024, and similar U.S. state laws related to \nchildren’s privacy, such as the New York Child Data Protection Act, and the United Kingdom’s Age-Appropriate \nDesign Code); and (4) laws regulating internet-connected devices (such as, in California, the Internet of Things \nSecurity Law).\n•\nThe EU’s Digital Markets Act, which will require in-scope companies to obtain user consent for combining data \nacross certain products and require search engines to share anonymized data with rival companies, among \nother changes; and the EU Data Act, which introduces new data portability requirements with respect to \nconnected products (i.e., ‘internet of things’ products) and related services, as well as interoperability \nobligations on data processing services. \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n21.  \n\nFurther, we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances \nwe can transfer, process and/or receive personal data, as well as ongoing enforcement actions from supervisory \nauthorities related to cross-border transfers of personal data. The validity of various data transfer mechanisms we \ncurrently rely upon remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments globally, which may require us to \nadapt our existing arrangements.\nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, violation of \nrights of publicity, and other claims that could be costly to defend, result in significant damage awards or \nother costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to use certain technologies. \nWe, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations \nof infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and \ntrademarks. Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts \nand the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-\nholding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims \nagainst us. As we continue to expand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased \nand may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies, including AI \ntechnologies. \nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing \nagreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or \nelsewhere, including by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain \njurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues \nfor us and otherwise harm our business. \nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend \nagainst certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual \nproperty infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or \nsignificant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also \ndiscontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could \nresult in loss of revenues and harm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our \nsuppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from \nintellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in \nthe future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual \nproperty claims. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to \nlitigate or settle. To the extent such claims are successful, they could harm our business, including our product and \nservice offerings, financial condition, and operating results. \nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or \nexposure to additional tax liabilities. \nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. \nOur effective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with \ndifferent statutory tax rates, net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk \nmanagement program, changes in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation, changes in the \nvaluation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax \nlaws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws). Further, if we are \nunable or fail to collect taxes on behalf of customers, employees and partners as the withholding agent, we could \nbecome liable for taxes that are levied against third parties. \nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have \nreceived, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such \nas transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit \ncould harm our financial condition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject \nus to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income \ntaxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. Although we believe our \nestimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements \nand may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. \nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions \nmay be subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. For \nexample, various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital \nservices taxes and other targeted taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n22.  \n\nregimes. The U.S. has imposed a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of shares repurchased, which could \npotentially increase in the future. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is \ncoordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial \nchanges to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%, on \nwhich various jurisdictions around the world have either introduced draft legislation or adopted final legislation. Our \neffective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase as a result of these changes.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock \nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program or dividend program will be continuously active \nor fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases or dividends could \nincrease the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves.\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with \nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and \ndoes not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. In \nApril 2024, we announced the approval of our cash dividend program and began paying regular cash dividends to our \nClass A, Class B, and Class C stockholders. Any and all future cash dividends are subject to declaration by our Board \nof Directors in its sole discretion, and in accordance with the requirements of any applicable laws, rules, and \nregulations, including the Delaware General Corporation Law. Our cash dividend program does not require, and our \nBoard of Directors may decide not to declare, a cash dividend each quarter, and does not obligate our Board of \nDirectors to declare a dividend at any specific dollar amount per share. Any such decision by our Board of Directors \nmay depend on a variety of factors that it may deem relevant, including but not limited to our earnings, liquidity, \nfinancial condition, other capital deployment opportunities, level of indebtedness, and general market conditions. Our \nshare repurchases or dividends could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves \nand may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock. \nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters. \nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has \nno voting rights. As of December 31, 2024, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 87.4% of our \noutstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 52.1% of the voting power of our outstanding common \nstock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring \nstockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or \nother sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no \nvoting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based \nacquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey’s current \nrelative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters \nsubmitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also \naffect Larry and Sergey’s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’ \nability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, \nwhich could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock. \nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that \nstockholders may consider favorable. \nProvisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a \nchange of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following: \n•\nOur Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of \nDirectors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director.\n•\nOur stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding \na stockholders' meeting.\n•\nOur certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of \nminority stockholders to elect director candidates.\n•\nStockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to \npropose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter \na potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or \notherwise attempting to obtain control of our company. \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n23.  \n\n•\nOur Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, \nwhich makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or \npreferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us. \nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware \nlaw, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting \nstock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved \nthe transaction. Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us. \nThe trading price for our Class A stock and non-voting Class C stock may continue to be volatile. \nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In \naddition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have \nfluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, including, among others, the size or \ncontinuity of either our share repurchase or dividend programs, the activities of our peers and changes in broader \neconomic and political conditions around the world. These broad market and industry factors could harm the market \nprice of our Class A stock and our Class C stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nGeneral Risks \nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our \nresults to fall short of expectations. \nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future fluctuate, as a result of a number of factors, many \noutside of our control, including the cyclical nature and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events. As a result, \ncomparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis \nmay not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. \nConsequently, our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. \nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, \nand other consequences that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy \nand use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect \nto continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic arrangements, \nwhich could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include: \n•\ndiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and \nother strategic arrangements; \n•\nfailure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities; conditions placed \nupon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise \nrestrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction; or investigations or \nlitigation by governmental authorities related to our acquisitions and other strategic arrangements;\n•\nfailure to successfully integrate the acquired operations, technologies, services, and personnel (including \ncultural integration and retention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology; \n•\nimplementation of controls (or remediation of control deficiencies), procedures, and policies at the acquired \ncompany; \n•\nintegration of the acquired company’s accounting and other administrative systems, and the coordination of \nproduct, engineering, and sales and marketing functions;\n•\ntransition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;\n•\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages \nand to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific \ncountries; \n•\nfailure to accomplish commercial, strategic or financial objectives with respect to investments, joint ventures, \nand other strategic arrangements;\n•\nfailure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity;\n•\nliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark \ninfringement claims, data privacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, \nwarranty claims, product liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n24.  \n\n•\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated \nemployees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions \nand other strategic arrangements could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated \nliabilities, and harm our business generally. \nOur acquisitions and other strategic arrangements could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, \nthe incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased \nlong-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results. \nAlso, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic arrangements may not materialize. In \nconnection with our divestitures and certain other strategic arrangements, we have agreed, and may in the future \nagree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, which could harm our financial condition and operating \nresults. \nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire \nqualified personnel, or maintain and continue to adapt our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow or \noperate effectively. \nOur performance and future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key technical leads as \nwell as members of our senior management team. For instance, Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of \nAlphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of our technology, maintaining our \nculture, and setting our strategic direction. \nOur ability to compete effectively and our future success depend on our continuing to identify, hire, develop, \nmotivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified \nemployees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted, and may continue to target, our \nemployees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be \nsuccessful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Immigration policy and \nregulatory changes may also affect our ability to hire, mobilize, or retain some of our global talent. All of our executive \nofficers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies.\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization \ngrows and evolves, we may need to adapt our corporate culture and work environments to ever-changing \ncircumstances, such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, and these changes could affect our ability to \ncompete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate culture. Under our hybrid work models, we may \nexperience increased costs and/or disruption, in addition to potential effects on our ability to operate effectively and \nmaintain our corporate culture. \nITEM 1B.\nUNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 1C.  CYBERSECURITY\nWe maintain a comprehensive process for identifying, assessing, and managing material risks from cybersecurity \nthreats as part of our broader risk management system and processes. For example, some risks include our software \nsupply chain and other third-party dependencies, vulnerabilities in our products and services, theft of our intellectual \nproperty, and attempts to compromise our infrastructure. We obtain input, as appropriate, for our cybersecurity risk \nmanagement program on the security industry and threat trends from multiple external experts and internal threat \nintelligence teams. Teams of dedicated privacy, safety, and security professionals oversee cybersecurity risk \nmanagement and mitigation, incident prevention, detection, and remediation. These teams comprise professionals with \ndeep cybersecurity expertise across multiple industries and are led by our Vice President of Privacy, Safety, and \nSecurity Engineering, who has 20 years of experience, including roles in technology infrastructure for two other large \npublic companies. Our executive leadership team, along with input from the above teams, are responsible for our \noverall enterprise risk management system and processes and regularly consider cybersecurity risks in the context of \nother material risks to the company.\nAs part of our cybersecurity risk management system, our incident management teams track and log privacy and \nsecurity incidents across Alphabet, our vendors, and other third-party service providers to remediate and resolve any \nsuch incidents. Significant incidents are reviewed regularly by a cross-functional working group to determine whether \nfurther escalation is appropriate. Any incident assessed as potentially being or potentially becoming material is \npromptly escalated for further assessment, and then reported to designated members of our senior management. We \nconsult with outside counsel as appropriate, including on materiality analysis and disclosure matters, and our senior \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n25.  \n\nmanagement makes the final materiality determinations and disclosure and other compliance decisions. Our \nmanagement apprises Alphabet’s independent public accounting firm of matters and any relevant developments.\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee has oversight responsibility for risks and incidents relating to cybersecurity \nthreats, including compliance with disclosure requirements, cooperation with law enforcement, and related effects on \nfinancial and other risks, and it reports any findings and recommendations, as appropriate, to the full Board for \nconsideration. Senior management regularly discusses cyber risks and trends and, should they arise, any material \nincidents with the Audit and Compliance Committee. Internal Audit maintains a dedicated cybersecurity auditing team \nthat independently tests our cybersecurity controls. \nOur business strategy, results of operations and financial condition have not been materially affected by risks from \ncybersecurity threats, including as a result of previously identified cybersecurity incidents, but we cannot provide \nassurance that they will not be materially affected in the future by such risks or any future material incidents. For more \ninformation on our cybersecurity related risks, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES\nOur headquarters are located in Mountain View, California.

Our Class A stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG” \nsince August 19, 2004, and under the symbol \"GOOGL\" since April 3, 2014. Prior to August 19, 2004, there was no \npublic market for our stock. Our Class B stock is neither listed nor traded. Our Class C stock has been listed on the \nNasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG” since April 3, 2014.\nHolders of Record\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were approximately 7,743 and 1,671 stockholders of record of our Class A stock \nand Class C stock, respectively. Because many of our shares of Class A stock and Class C stock are held by brokers \nand other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders \nrepresented by these record holders. As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately 57 stockholders of record of \nour Class B stock.\nDividend Program\nDividend payments to stockholders of Class A, Class B, and Class C shares were $3.5 billion, $519 million, and \n$3.3 billion, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024. The company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends \nin the future, subject to review and approval by the company’s Board of Directors in its sole discretion.

Discussion of 2023 results \ncompared to 2022 results to the extent not included in this report can be found in Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report on \nForm 10-K.\nUnderstanding Alphabet’s Financial Results\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, \nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further \ndetails on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 Business and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \nincluded in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate \nthat they will continue to affect our future results:\n•\nUsers' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\nThe continuing evolution of the online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since \ninception. We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower \npace than we have experienced historically. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and \nadvertisers, including from other developers and providers of AI products and services, which may affect our revenues.\n•\nUsers continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which \nallows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\nOur users are accessing our products and services via diverse devices and modalities beyond traditional desktop, \nsuch as smartphones, wearables, connected TVs, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no \nmatter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front \nof these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising \nformats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional \ndesktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues \nmay be affected. For example, changing dynamics within the global smartphone market, such as increased market \nsaturation in developed countries, can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow \nand TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic \nmix; partner agreement terms; partner mix; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product \nmix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\n•\nAs online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our \nmonetization.\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, for example with AI, \nwe continue to expand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect monetization of our \nproducts and services. We expect to continue to incorporate AI innovations into our products, such as AI in Search, \nthat could affect our monetization trends. When developing new products and services we generally focus first on user \nexperience and then on monetization.\n•\nAs users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets \ncontinue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange \nrates affect such revenues. \nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., \nincluding in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our \nproducts and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n30.  \n\nrevenues from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these \nmarkets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as \ndeveloping markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign \ncurrency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program \ndesigned to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues \nand earnings.\n•\nThe revenues that we derive beyond advertising are increasing and may adversely affect our margins.\nRevenues from cloud, consumer subscriptions, platforms, and devices, which may have differing characteristics \nthan our advertising revenues, have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding \nour products and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins \non our advertising revenues. For example, sales of our devices adversely affect our consolidated margins due to \npressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.\n•\nAs we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and \ncapital expenditures.\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to \ndevelop new, innovative offerings, improve our existing offerings, and rapidly and responsibly deploy AI across our \nbusinesses. We also expect to increase, relative to 2024, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including \nservers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in \nparticular in support of AI products and services. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments remain important \nelements in our use of capital and contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in \nengineering and other functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives.\n•\nWe continue to face an evolving regulatory environment, and we are subject to claims, lawsuits, \ninvestigations, and other forms of potential legal liability, which could affect our business practices and \nfinancial results.\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide \nrange of topics and related legal matters, including investigations, lawsuits, and regulatory actions, have resulted in \nfines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may \nincrease, our products and services may become less useful, our ability to pursue certain business practices or offer \ncertain products or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business models and operations to \ncomply with evolving regulatory and legal matters. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors and \nLegal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on \nForm 10-K.\n•\nOur employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue \nhiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional \ninformation, see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide \nenterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and \nservices, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. For \nadditional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \nincluded in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed above, fluctuations in our \nrevenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including:\n•\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n•\nchanges in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives;\n•\ngeneral economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and \nother measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; \n•\nnew product, service, and market launches; and\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n31.  \n\n•\nseasonality.\nAdditionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (\"Google advertising\"), other sources \n(\"Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices\"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets have been, and may continue to be, \naffected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.\nGoogle Services\nGoogle Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices \nrevenues.\nGoogle Advertising\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following: \n•\nGoogle Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues \nfrom traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, \ntoolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n•\nYouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\n•\nGoogle Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, \nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nWe use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our \nadvertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while \nimpressions and cost-per-impression pertain to traffic on our Google Network properties.\nPaid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search \nproperties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play. Cost-\nper-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average \namount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in \nAdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based \nrevenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for \neach impression displayed to users.\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, \nand counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by \nthe corresponding click and impression activity.\nFluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search \n& other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the \ncorrelation between these items have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general \nfactors described above, such as:\n•\nadvertiser competition for keywords;\n•\nchanges in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;\n•\nchanges in device mix;\n•\nseasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as \ntraditional retail seasonality; and\n•\ntraffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and \nchannels.\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues are comprised of the following:\n•\nconsumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, \nYouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\n•\nplatforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases;\n•\ndevices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\n•\nother products and services.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n32.  \n\nFluctuations in our Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues have been, and may continue to be, \naffected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and \ndemand, number of subscribers, and the timing of product launches.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:\n•\nGoogle Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, \nplatform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as AI offerings including our AI \ninfrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n•\nGoogle Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for \nenterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google \nWorkspace; and\n•\nother enterprise services.\nFluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to \nthe general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand.\nOther Bets\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services, and internet \nservices.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses \ninclude costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and \nexpenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our \noperating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, \nfluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, due to factors \nsuch as annual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally vest over four years.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n•\nTAC includes: \n◦\namounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. \nOur distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, \nand software developers; and\n◦\namounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n•\nOther cost of revenues primarily includes:\n◦\ncontent acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and \nother content for distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content providers \nbased on revenues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n◦\ndepreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;\n◦\nemployee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as \ncontent review and customer and product support;\n◦\ninventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and\n◦\nother technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment \ncosts.\nTAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly \nhigher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, \nbecause most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our \nGoogle Network partners.\nOperating Expenses\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n33.  \n\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either \nR&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.\nThe main components of our R&D expenses are:\n•\ndepreciation;\n•\nemployee compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to \nour existing and new products and services; and \n•\nthird-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering \nand product development efforts.\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\n•\nemployee compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain \ncustomer service functions; and\n•\nspend relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\n•\nemployee compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, \nand other administrative support functions; \n•\nexpenses relating to legal and other matters, including certain fines and settlements; and \n•\nthird-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative \nservices.\nOther Income (Expense), Net \nOI&E, net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains (losses), \nnet gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, and income \n(loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.\nFor additional information, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in \nthe value of our investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \nItem 8 as well as Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this Annual Report on Form \n10-K.\nProvision for Income Taxes \nProvision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred \nin the U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision includes the effect of reserve provisions and \nchanges to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.\nFor additional information, including a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate, see \nNote 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n34.  \n\nExecutive Overview\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated financial results (in millions, except for per share information \nand percentages):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\nConsolidated revenues\n$ 307,394 \n$ 350,018 \n$ \n42,624 \n 14 %\nChange in consolidated constant currency revenues(1)\n 15 %\nCost of revenues\n$ 133,332 \n$ 146,306 \n$ \n12,974 \n 10 %\nOperating expenses\n$ 89,769 \n$ 91,322 \n$ \n1,553 \n 2 %\nOperating income\n$ 84,293 \n$ 112,390 \n$ \n28,097 \n 33 %\nOperating margin\n 27 %\n 32 %\n 5 %\nOther income (expense), net\n$ \n1,424 \n$ \n7,425 \n$ \n6,001 \n 421 %\nNet income\n$ 73,795 \n$ 100,118 \n$ \n26,323 \n 36 %\nDiluted EPS(2)\n$ \n5.80 \n$ \n8.04 \n$ \n2.24 \n 39 %\n(1) \nSee \"Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information\" below for details relating to our use of constant currency information. \n(2) \nFor additional information on the calculation of diluted EPS, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \nincluded in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n•\nRevenues were $350.0 billion, an increase of 14% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in Google \nServices revenues of $32.4 billion, or 12%, and an increase in Google Cloud revenues of $10.1 billion, or 31%.\n•\nTotal constant currency revenues, which exclude the effect of hedging, increased 15% year over year.\n•\nCost of revenues was $146.3 billion, an increase of 10% year over year, primarily driven by increases in \ncontent acquisition costs, TAC, and depreciation expense. \n•\nOperating expenses were $91.3 billion, an increase of 2% year over year, primarily driven by increases in \ndepreciation expense, employee compensation expenses, and third-party services fees. These increases were \npartially offset by reductions in charges related to legal and other matters and charges related to our office \nspace optimization efforts. The overall increase in employee compensation expenses was partially offset by a \nreduction in employee severance and related charges.\nOther Information:\n•\nDividend payments to stockholders of Class A, Class B, and Class C shares, which were first paid in June \n2024, were $3.5 billion, $519 million, and $3.3 billion, respectively, totaling $7.4 billion for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024.

For additional information, see Note 11 of the Notes to \nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n•\nEmployee severance and related charges for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $1.0 billion, a decrease \nof $1.1 billion as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Office space charges, including accelerated \nrent and accelerated depreciation, for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $796 million, a decrease of \n$1.3 billion as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Substantially all of these charges were \nincluded in Alphabet-level activities. \n•\nOperating cash flow was $125.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n•\nCapital expenditures, which primarily reflected investments in technical infrastructure, were $52.5 billion for the \nyear ended December 31, 2024.\n•\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 183,323 employees.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n35.  \n\nFinancial Results\nRevenues\nThe following table presents revenues by type (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023\n2024\nGoogle Search & other\n$ \n175,033 $ \n198,084 \nYouTube ads\n \n31,510  \n36,147 \nGoogle Network\n \n31,312  \n30,359 \nGoogle advertising\n \n237,855  \n264,590 \nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices\n \n34,688  \n40,340 \nGoogle Services total\n \n272,543  \n304,930 \nGoogle Cloud\n \n33,088  \n43,229 \nOther Bets\n \n1,527  \n1,648 \nHedging gains (losses)\n \n236  \n211 \nTotal revenues\n$ \n307,394 $ \n350,018 \nGoogle Services\nGoogle advertising revenues\nGoogle Search & other\nGoogle Search & other revenues increased $23.1 billion from 2023 to 2024. The overall growth was driven by \ninterrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage on mobile \ndevices; growth in advertiser spending; and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery.\nYouTube ads\nYouTube ads revenues increased $4.6 billion from 2023 to 2024. The growth was driven by our brand advertising \nproducts followed by our direct response advertising products, both of which benefited from increased spending by our \nadvertisers.\nGoogle Network\nGoogle Network revenues decreased $953 million from 2023 to 2024, primarily driven by a decrease in Google \nAd Manager and AdMob revenues. Additionally, Google Network revenues were adversely affected by changes in \nforeign currency exchange rates.\nMonetization Metrics\nThe following table presents changes in monetization metrics for Google Search & other revenues (paid clicks \nand cost-per-click) and Google Network revenues (impressions and cost-per-impression), expressed as a percentage, \nfrom 2023 to 2024:\nGoogle Search & other\nPaid clicks change\n 5 %\nCost-per-click change\n 7 %\nGoogle Network\nImpressions change\n (11) %\nCost-per-impression change\n 10 %\nChanges in paid clicks and impressions are driven by a number of interrelated factors, including changes in \nadvertiser spending; ongoing product and policy changes; and, as it relates to paid clicks, fluctuations in search \nqueries resulting from changes in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices.\nChanges in cost-per-click and cost-per-impression are driven by a number of interrelated factors including \nchanges in device mix, geographic mix, advertiser spending, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, \nproperty mix, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n36.  \n\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues increased $5.7 billion from 2023 to 2024. The growth was \nprimarily driven by an increase in subscription revenues, largely from growth in the number of paid subscribers for \nYouTube services followed by Google One. \nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle Cloud revenues increased $10.1 billion from 2023 to 2024 primarily driven by growth in Google Cloud \nPlatform largely from infrastructure services.\nRevenues by Geography\nThe following table presents revenues by geography as a percentage of revenues, determined based on the \naddresses of our customers:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2023\n2024\nUnited States\n 47 %\n 49 %\nEMEA\n 30 %\n 29 %\nAPAC\n 17 %\n 16 %\nOther Americas\n 6 %\n 6 %\nHedging gains (losses)\n 0 %\n 0 %\nFor additional information, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nUse of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information\nInternational revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple \ncurrencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period \ncomparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP \npercentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial \nand operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the \npresentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles \n(GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign \ncurrency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant \nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency \nexchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. \nWe use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year \nbasis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable \nperiod exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period \nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated \nusing prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with \nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures \nused by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n37.  \n\nThe following table presents the foreign currency exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues (in \nmillions, except percentages):\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\n% Change from Prior Period\nYear Ended December 31,\nLess FX \nEffect\nConstant \nCurrency \nRevenues\nAs \nReported\nLess \nHedging \nEffect\nLess FX \nEffect\nConstant \nCurrency \nRevenues\n2023\n2024\nUnited States\n$ \n146,286 \n$ \n170,447 \n$ \n0 \n$ 170,447 \n 17 %\n 0 %\n 17 %\nEMEA\n \n91,038 \n \n102,127 \n \n41 \n \n102,086 \n 12 %\n 0 %\n 12 %\nAPAC\n \n51,514 \n \n56,815 \n \n(1,369)  \n58,184 \n 10 %\n (3) %\n 13 %\nOther Americas\n \n18,320 \n \n20,418 \n \n(1,608)  \n22,026 \n 11 %\n (9) %\n 20 %\nRevenues, excluding hedging effect  \n307,158 \n \n349,807 \n \n(2,936)  \n352,743 \n 14 %\n (1) %\n 15 %\nHedging gains (losses)\n \n236 \n \n211 \nTotal revenues(1)\n$ \n307,394 \n$ \n350,018 \n$ 352,743 \n 14 %\n 0 %\n (1) %\n 15 %\n(1)\nTotal constant currency revenues of $352.7 billion for 2024 increased $45.6 billion compared to $307.2 billion in revenues, \nexcluding hedging effect, for 2023.\nEMEA revenue growth was not materially affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as the effect of \nthe U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Turkish lira was offset by the U.S. dollar weakening relative to the British \npound and the euro.\nAPAC revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to \nthe U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Japanese yen.\nOther Americas revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, \nprimarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the Argentine peso and the Brazilian real.\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of Revenues\nThe following table presents cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, except percentages):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2023\n2024\nTAC\n$ \n50,886 \n$ \n54,900 \nOther cost of revenues\n \n82,446 \n \n91,406 \nTotal cost of revenues\n$ \n133,332 \n$ \n146,306 \nTotal cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues\n 43 %\n 42 %\nCost of revenues increased $13.0 billion from 2023 to 2024 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC \nof $9.0 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively.\nThe increase in TAC from 2023 to 2024 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, \nprimarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.4% to 20.7% from 2023 to \n2024 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The \nTAC rate on Google Search & other revenues increased from 2023 to 2024 primarily due to increases related to mobile \nsearches, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. The \nTAC rate on Google Network revenues was substantially consistent from 2023 to 2024.\nThe increase in other cost of revenues from 2023 to 2024 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition \ncosts, largely for YouTube, depreciation expense, and other technical infrastructure operations costs.\nResearch and Development\nThe following table presents R&D expenses (in millions, except percentages):\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n38.  \n\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2023\n2024\nResearch and development expenses\n$ \n45,427 \n$ \n49,326 \nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of revenues\n 15 %\n 14 %\nR&D expenses increased $3.9 billion from 2023 to 2024, primarily driven by increases in employee compensation \nexpenses of $1.5 billion, depreciation expense of $1.4 billion, and third-party services fees of $698 million, partially \noffset by a reduction in charges related to our office space optimization efforts of $640 million. The increase in \nemployee compensation expenses was primarily driven by a $1.3 billion increase in SBC expenses, which includes the \nreduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets recognized in the prior year \ncomparable period, partially offset by a $537 million decrease in severance and related charges.\nSales and Marketing\nThe following table presents sales and marketing expenses (in millions, except percentages):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2023\n2024\nSales and marketing expenses\n$ \n27,917 \n$ \n27,808 \nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues\n 9 %\n 8 %\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $109 million from 2023 to 2024, due to a combination of factors, none \nof which were individually significant.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe following table presents general and administrative expenses (in millions, except percentages):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2023\n2024\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n$ \n16,425 \n$ \n14,188 \nGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues\n 5 %\n 4 %\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $2.2 billion from 2023 to 2024, primarily driven by a reduction in \ncharges related to legal and other matters of $1.3 billion and a decrease in employee compensation expenses of $285 \nmillion, primarily due to a decrease in average headcount, in addition to a combination of factors, none of which were \nindividually significant. \nSegment Profitability\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets.

The increase in operating income \nwas primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in content acquisition costs and TAC. \nAdditionally, a reduction in employee compensation expenses contributed to the increase in operating income.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle Cloud operating income increased $4.4 billion from 2023 to 2024. The increase in operating income was \nprimarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in usage costs for technical infrastructure as \nwell as employee compensation expenses, largely driven by headcount growth.\nOther Bets \nOther Bets operating loss increased $349 million from 2023 to 2024. The increase in operating loss was primarily \ndue to an increase in expenses, largely driven by employee compensation expenses in addition to a combination of \nfactors, none of which were individually significant. The increase in employee compensation expenses was primarily as \na result of the reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets recognized in the prior \nyear comparable period.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents OI&E, (in millions):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2023\n2024\nInterest income\n$ \n3,865 $ \n4,482 \nInterest expense\n \n(308)  \n(268) \nForeign currency exchange gain (loss), net\n \n(1,238)  \n(409) \nGain (loss) on debt securities, net\n \n(1,215)  \n(1,043) \nGain (loss) on equity securities, net\n \n392  \n3,714 \nPerformance fees\n \n257  \n218 \nIncome (loss) and impairment from equity method investments, net\n \n(628)  \n(188) \nOther\n \n299  \n919 \nOther income (expense), net\n$ \n1,424 $ \n7,425 \nOI&E, net increased $6.0 billion from 2023 to 2024 primarily due to an increase in net gains on equity securities \nand a decrease in net losses on foreign currency exchange. The net gains on equity securities were primarily due to \nnet unrealized gains on non-marketable equity securities driven by fair value adjustments related to observable \ntransactions, partially offset by a decrease in net unrealized gains on marketable equity securities due to market-driven \nchanges. Foreign currency exchange net losses decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to prior year \nlosses in unhedged currencies.\nIn January 2025, we recognized an $8.0 billion unrealized gain on our non-marketable equity securities related to \nour investment in a private company. The unrealized gain reflects an increase in the fair value measurement of our \ninvestment following an observable transaction in January 2025. \nFor additional information, see Note 3 and Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \nItem 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except effective tax rate):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2023\n2024\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n$ \n85,717 \n$ \n119,815 \nProvision for income taxes\n$ \n11,922 \n$ \n19,697 \nEffective tax rate\n 13.9 %\n 16.4 %\nThe effective tax rate increased from 2023 to 2024. This increase was primarily due to a one-time adjustment for \ntax rule changes issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that affected the 2023 rate related to U.S. federal \nforeign tax credits, as well as a separate rule change with guidance on the capitalization and amortization of R&D \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n40.  \n\nexpenses. Additionally, a decrease in the 2024 U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction \ncontributed to an increase in the effective tax rate. These factors were partially offset by an increase in stock-based \ncompensation-related tax benefits in 2024.\nThe OECD is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus \naround substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax \nrate of 15%. Some countries have already implemented the legislation effective January 1, 2024, and we expect others \nto follow, however this did not have a material effect on our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year. \nFinancial Condition\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $95.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. \nCash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid \ngovernment bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity \nsecurities.\nSources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow \nthat we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the \nbusiness. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to \nstockholders.\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2023\n2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$ \n101,746 $ \n125,299 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n$ \n(27,063) $ \n(45,536) \nNet cash used in financing activities\n$ \n(72,093) $ \n(79,733) \nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search & other \nproperties, Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. In Google Services, we also generate cash through \nconsumer subscriptions, the sale of apps and in-app purchases, and devices. In Google Cloud, we generate cash \nthrough consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, applications, and other cloud services.\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network partners, \nto employees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities include \npayments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from 2023 to 2024 due to an increase in cash received from \ncustomers, partially offset by an increase in cash payments for cost of revenues and operating expenses.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and \nnon-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and non-\nmarketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from 2023 to 2024 primarily due to an increase in purchases of \nproperty and equipment and purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by increases in maturities and sales of \nmarketable securities. The increase in purchases of property and equipment is primarily driven by investments in \ntechnical infrastructure. \nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the \nsale of interests in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, \nnet payments related to stock-based award activities, payment of dividends, and repayments of debt.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from 2023 to 2024 due to dividend payments and net payments \nrelated to stock-based award activities, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of \nrepayments.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n41.  \n\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and cash flows from operations and \nfinancing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and \nfinancing activities for at least the next 12 months, and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\nWe make investments in land, buildings, and servers and network equipment through purchases of property and \nequipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\n•\ntechnical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, \nstorage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, and data center land and \nbuilding construction; and\n•\noffice facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\").\nAssets not yet in service are those that are not ready for our intended use, including assets in the process of \nconstruction or assembly, and consists primarily of technical infrastructure. The time frame from date of purchase to \nplacement in service of these assets may extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction \nprojects are generally multi-year projects with multiple phases, where we acquire land and buildings, construct \nbuildings, and secure and install servers and network equipment.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, we spent $32.3 billion and $52.5 billion on capital \nexpenditures, respectively. We expect to increase, relative to 2024, our investment in our technical infrastructure, \nincluding servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term \ninitiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences \nwhen the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. For the years ended \nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024, our depreciation on property and equipment was $11.9 billion and $15.3 billion, \nrespectively.\nLeases \nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, we recognized additional operating lease assets of $2.9 \nbillion and $2.5 billion, and additional finance lease assets of $564 million and $313 million, respectively. As of \nDecember 31, 2024, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, which had a weighted average \nremaining lease term of 7.8 years, was $17.0 billion, of which $3.2 billion is short-term, and total future lease payments \nunder finance leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.4 years, was $1.9 billion, of which \n$257 million is short-term. As of December 31, 2024, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with \nfuture short-term and long-term lease payments of $773 million and $6.5 billion, respectively, that are not yet recorded \non our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2025 and 2028 with non-cancelable lease \nterms of one to 25 years. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs) \nwere $4.5 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were $504 million and $444 million for the years \nended December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. For additional information, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated \nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinancing\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net \nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2024, we had $2.3 billion of \nshort-term commercial paper outstanding.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $11.9 billion \nwith short-term and long-term future interest payments of $197 million and $3.4 billion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2025 and \n$6.0 billion expiring in April 2028. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using \ncertain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability  goals. No amounts have \nbeen borrowed under the credit facilities. For additional information, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial \nStatements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n42.  \n\nWe primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure \nand devices we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then \nsupply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and devices. Certain of \nthese arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be \npresented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 8 of this Annual \nReport on Form 10-K.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 379 million shares for $62.0 billion.\nIn April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 \nbillion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2024, $44.7 billion remained available for Class A and \nClass C share repurchases.\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nShares\nAmount\nShares\nAmount\nClass A share repurchases\n78\n$ \n9,316 \n73\n$ \n11,855 \nClass C share repurchases\n450\n \n52,868 \n306\n \n50,192 \nTotal share repurchases(1)\n528\n$ \n62,184 \n379\n$ \n62,047 \n(1)         Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases.\nFor additional information, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of \nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDividend Program\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024 total cash dividends, which were first paid in June 2024, were $3.5 \nbillion, $519 million, and $3.3 billion for Class A, Class B, and Class C shares, respectively.\nThe company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the \ncompany’s Board of Directors in its sole discretion. \nEuropean Commission Fines\nIn 2017, 2018, and 2019, the European Commission (EC) announced decisions that certain actions taken by \nGoogle infringed European competition law and imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), €4.3 \nbillion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018), and €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. \nIn September 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but reduced the 2018 fine from €4.3 billion to \n€4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation of the EC decision with the European Court of \nJustice, which remains pending.\nIn September 2024, the European Court of Justice rejected our appeal of the 2017 decision and upheld the €2.4 \nbillion fine. In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the 2017 shopping fine.\nIn September 2024, the EU's General Court overturned the 2019 decision and annulled the €1.5 billion fine. The \nEC has appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice.\nWe included the outstanding EC fines, including any under appeal, in accrued expenses and other current \nliabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated \nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTaxes\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had income taxes payable of $2.7 billion related to a one-time transition tax \npayable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is due in 2025. We also had long-term taxes \npayable of $8.8 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024.\nPurchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $55.4 \nbillion, of which $32.5 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain technical \ninfrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to \ncommitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory, and network capacity. For those agreements \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n43.  \n\nwith variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as \nof December 31, 2024. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change based on the \nexpected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content licenses, see Note \n10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and \nenergy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar \ncommitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and \nare not readily determinable.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make \nestimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of \nuncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a \nmaterial effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from \nour estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable \nunder the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical \naccounting estimates with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.\nFor a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements, see Note 1 of the \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-\nmarketable equity securities. These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method (\"the \nmeasurement alternative\") and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments \nresulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments \nrequire quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs. \nAdjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and involve the use of \nestimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the \ncompanies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of \nimpairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market \napproach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount \nrates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. \nWhen the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its \ncurrent fair value.\nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e. \nperformance fees. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may \nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use \nof unobservable inputs.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when \nother changes occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use \nand utilization of assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we \nexpect to benefit from the asset.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating \nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of \ncomparable and resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain \ntax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial \nopinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately \nreserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not \nbe different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n44.  \n\ndifferences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination \nis made.\nThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the \nrelated net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns \nby the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of \nadverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for \nincome taxes.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, \nand consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, \nlabor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by \nadvertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these \nmatters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we \nbelieve that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine \nthat a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note \n10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that \nhas been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make \nadjustments and changes to our disclosures. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the \nestimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an \nexposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.\nITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, \nand equity investment risks. \nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. International revenues, as well as costs and expenses \ndenominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the \nU.S. dollar. As discussed below, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risk. Principal \ncurrencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen. For the \npurpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange \nrates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be \nexperienced.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on monetary assets and \nliabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option \ncontracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets \nand liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in OI&E, which are \noffset by the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to net monetary assets, liabilities, and \ncommitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have \nresulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $503 million and $135 million as of \nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for \nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a \ncombination of purchased and written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in \nforeign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option \ncontacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign \ncurrency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging \ncontracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate \nthese contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains and losses of foreign currency spot \nrate changes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them \ninto revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur. \nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the amount recorded in AOCI related to \nour cash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion lower as of \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n45.  \n\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a \ncorresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency \nrisks related to investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency \ntranslation risk from our foreign operations.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI \nrelated to our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $946 million and $660 million \nlower as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to \noffset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and \nmaintain liquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities, \nmortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate \nderivatives. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and \nfloating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair \nmarket value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income \nthan predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains and losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to \ninterest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt \nsecurities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. We measure \nsecurities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until \nthe securities are sold, less any expected credit losses. \nWe use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value \nof our investment portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our \ninvestment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with 95% \nconfidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2023 and \n2024 are shown below (in millions):\n \nAs of December 31,\n12-Month Average \nAs of December 31,\n \n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\nRisk category - interest rate\n$ \n296 $ \n208 $ \n271 $ \n230 \nActual future gains and losses associated with our investment portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity \nanalyses performed as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the \ntiming and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is not intended to \nrepresent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.\nEquity Investment Risk\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that \ncould substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are \ninvestments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily \ndeterminable market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and \nrepresent $6.0 billion and $5.1 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. A \nhypothetical adverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2024 balance would decrease the fair value of \nmarketable equity securities by $508 million. From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market \nprice risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are primarily adjusted to fair \nvalue for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as \nthe measurement alternative). The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an \nindication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the \nearly stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are \ntypically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition, \nwhich could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. Valuations of our equity \ninvestments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n46.  \n\nobservable transactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses. In addition, global economic conditions \ncould result in additional volatility. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on \nthe likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public \nofferings, acquisitions, private sales or other market events. Changes in the valuation of non-marketable equity \nsecurities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities. As of December 31, \n2023 and 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the \nmeasurement alternative, was $28.8 billion and $35.5 billion, respectively. \nThe carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion as \nof December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, \nthese investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.\nFor additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated \nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n47.  \n\nITEM 8.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nAlphabet Inc.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \nPage\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 42)\n49\nFinancial Statements:\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n52\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n53\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n54\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity\n55\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n56\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n57\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n48.  \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alphabet Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, \n2023 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash \nflows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial \nstatement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In \nour opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the \nCompany at December 31, 2023 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three \nyears in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria \nestablished in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the \nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 4, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion \nthereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an \nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with \nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal \nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material \nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material \nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to \nthose risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in \nthe financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates \nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our \naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial \nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to \naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, \nsubjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion \non the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter \nbelow, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n49.  \n\nLoss Contingencies \nDescription of \nthe Matter\nThe Company is subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and \ninvestigations, other proceedings, and orders involving competition, intellectual property, data \nprivacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, \ncontent generated by its users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using their \nplatforms, personal injury, and other matters. As described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial \nstatements “Commitments and Contingencies” such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government \ninquiries and investigations, other proceedings, and orders could result in adverse consequences.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the estimated amount of a \nloss related to such matters. Auditing management’s accounting for and disclosure of loss \ncontingencies from these matters involved challenging and subjective auditor judgment in \nassessing the Company’s evaluation of the probability of a loss, and the estimated amount or \nrange of loss.\nHow We \nAddressed the \nMatter in Our \nAudit\nWe tested relevant controls over the identified risks associated with management’s accounting for \nand disclosure of these matters. This included controls over management’s assessment of the \nprobability of incurrence of a loss and whether the loss or range of loss was reasonably estimable \nand the development of related disclosures.\nOur audit procedures included gaining an understanding of previous rulings and the status of \nongoing lawsuits, reviewing letters from internal and external legal counsel addressing the matters, \nmeeting with internal legal counsel to discuss the allegations, and obtaining a representation letter \nfrom management on these matters. We also evaluated the Company’s disclosures in relation to \nthese matters.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1999.\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 4, 2025\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n50.  \n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Alphabet Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria \nestablished in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the \nTreadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Alphabet Inc. (the Company) maintained, \nin all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO \ncriteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \nStates) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 4, 2025 \nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its \nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying \nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the \nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with \nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal \nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was \nmaintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a \nmaterial weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on \nthe assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We \nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding \nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with \ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies \nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the \ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are \nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations \nof management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely \ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on \nthe financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become \ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \ndeteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 4, 2025\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n51.  \n\nAlphabet Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in millions, except par value per

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August \n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became \nthe successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide \nenterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and \nservices, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated \nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and \nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. \nActual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our \nestimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; contingent liabilities; fair values of financial \ninstruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among others. We \nbase our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the \nresults of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and \nthe collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other \nsimilar taxes are excluded from revenues. \nAdvertising Revenues\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\n•\nGoogle Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners \nwho use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated \nproperties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n•\nYouTube properties; and\n•\nGoogle Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, \nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google \nDisplay & Video 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for \nperformance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues \nwhen the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on \na gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed \non Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, \nand amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we \ncontrol the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to \nmonetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being \nprimarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\nGoogle Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues consist of revenues from:\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n57.  \n\n•\nconsumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, \nYouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\n•\nplatforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases;\n•\ndevices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\n•\nother products and services.\nSubscription revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the subscription, primarily monthly. We report \nrevenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases on a net basis because our performance obligation is \nto facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users for which we earn a service fee. \nGoogle Cloud Revenues\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\n•\nGoogle Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, \nplatform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as AI offerings including our AI \ninfrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n•\nGoogle Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for \nenterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google \nWorkspace; and\n•\nother enterprise services.\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract \nterms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when \nthe customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services \nprovided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and \nconsumes the benefits of the cloud services.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate \nrevenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine \nstandalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. \nWe estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We \nbelieve that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration related to customer \nincentives and credits.\nSales Commissions\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We \nrecognize an asset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year. \nThese costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n•\nTAC includes:\n◦\namounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. \nOur distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, \nand software developers; and\n◦\namounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n•\nOther cost of revenues includes:\n◦\ncontent acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and \nother content for distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content providers \nbased on revenues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n◦\ndepreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n58.  \n\n◦\nemployee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as \ncontent review and customer and product support;\n◦\ninventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and\n◦\nother technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment \ncosts.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software \ncomponent of products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. \nTechnological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs \nthat meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and \ncloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software \napplications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the \nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications \nwere not material for the periods presented.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation (SBC) primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity \nclassified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense \nusing the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur. \nRSUs are awarded dividend equivalents, which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying award, \nand settled in Class C shares.\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be \npaid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and \nthe income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nAdditionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include \nmarket conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies. PSUs and \ncertain awards granted by Other Bet companies are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite \nservice period. Certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value \nthrough settlement. The fair value of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity valuation of the \nrespective Other Bet company.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended \nDecember 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $9.2 billion, $8.7 \nbillion, and $8.7 billion, respectively.\nPerformance Fees\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain \ninvestments. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may \nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use \nof unobservable inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of OI&E.\nFair Value Measurements \nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a \nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured \nand classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in \nthe market used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active \nmarkets.\nLevel 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for \nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all \nsignificant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n59.  \n\nthese models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based \nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of \nunobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate \nvaluation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models.\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, \nmarketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets \nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and \nliabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\nWe measure certain other instruments, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also \nat fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\nFinancial Instruments\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative \nfinancial instruments, accounts receivable, and convertible notes.\nCredit Risks\nWe are subject to credit risk primarily from cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, derivative financial \ninstruments, including foreign exchange contracts, accounts receivable, and convertible notes. We manage our credit \nrisk exposure through timely assessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits, and use of collateral \nmanagement. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. \nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the \nworld. We manage our credit risk exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we \nlimit the amount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers.\nCash Equivalents\nWe invest excess cash primarily in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities, \ngovernment bonds, money market funds, and time deposits.\nMarketable Securities\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of \npurchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities \non our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable \ndebt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have \nclassified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus \nreward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective \nmaturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities \nwith maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated \nBalance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a \ncomponent of stockholders’ equity, except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded \nin OI&E. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value \nare recorded in OI&E. We determine any realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a \nspecific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of OI&E.\nOur investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses, \nincluding unrealized, recognized in OI&E. We classify our marketable equity securities subject to long-term lock-up \nrestrictions beyond 12 months as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNon-Marketable Securities\nNon-marketable securities primarily consist of equity securities. We account for non-marketable equity securities \nthrough which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method. \nOther non-marketable equity securities that we hold are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative. \nUnder the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus \nchanges resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the \nsame issuer. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are \nrecorded as a component of OI&E.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n60.  \n\nNon-marketable securities that do not have effective contractual maturity dates are classified as other non-\ncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nSee Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments. \nAccounts Receivable\nOur payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or \nservices offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or \nservices and customers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. \nAdditionally, accounts receivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the \ncustomer.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts \nreceivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements \nof Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics \nexist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In \ndetermining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status \nand make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider \ncustomer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic \nconditions.\nConvertible Notes\nOur investments in convertible notes are primarily recorded at amortized cost which includes unpaid principal \nbalances, deferred origination costs, and any related discount or premium, net of allowances for credit losses, and are \nincluded within other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also entered into \ncommercial arrangements at or near the same time. For these transactions, judgment is required in assessing the \nsubstance of the arrangements, including assessing whether the components of the arrangements should be \naccounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP, and determining the value of the components of \nthe arrangements, including the fair value of the investments. Additionally, if our investment in such companies \nbecomes impaired, we may need to re-evaluate the accounting for the commercial arrangement, including reducing \nany remaining performance obligations.\nImpairment of Investments\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment. \nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is \nestimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past \nevents, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to OI&E, \nnot to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If \nwe have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized \nloss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the \ncorresponding charge as a component of OI&E.\nFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment \nindicators exist by evaluating the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among \nother indicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair \nvalue by recording the corresponding charge as a component of OI&E. We prepare quantitative measurements of the \nfair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.\nInventory\nInventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is \ncomputed using the first-in, first-out method.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in \nwhich we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n61.  \n\nthe primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most \nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses \nor benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a \nVIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination \nof whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. \nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is comprised of technical infrastructure, office space, corporate and other assets \ncurrently in service, and assets not yet in service. Technical infrastructure includes data center land, buildings and \nleasehold improvements, and servers and network equipment. Office space includes office land, buildings and \nleasehold improvements. Assets not yet in service are those that are not ready for our intended use, including data \ncenter buildings and servers in the process of construction or assembly. \nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation commences once assets \nare ready for our intended use and is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the \nassets, which we regularly evaluate for factors such as technological obsolescence and our planned use and \nutilization. We depreciate data center and office buildings over periods of seven to 40 years. We depreciate servers \nand network equipment generally over a period of six years. We depreciate corporate and other assets over periods of \ntwo to 25 years. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated \nuseful lives of the assets. Land is not depreciated. \nGoodwill\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We \nevaluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in \nreporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for \nimpairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be \nimpaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-\nlease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily \ninclude payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease \npayments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets \nand liabilities.\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the \nlease assets and liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and \npayments for maintenance and utilities.\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease \ncommencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our \nincremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental \nborrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, \nand in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to \nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the \nbase, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any \nprepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\nLease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our \noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is \nincluded in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease \nliabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or other long-term liabilities.\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease \nterm. Finance lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life \nof the asset, and interest expense is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review leases, property and equipment, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when \nevents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n62.  \n\nat the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by \ncomparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected \nto generate. If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is \nmeasured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes \npayable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of \nevents that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax \nassets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of future realization of our \ndeferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets \nwhen it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax \nassets when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the \nglobal intangible low tax income provision as a current period expense.\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on \ntechnical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the \nfinancial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be \nrealized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to \nunrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the \npurchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, \nexcept for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The \nexcess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. \nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nForeign Currency\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange \nrates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the period derived from month-end exchange rates for revenues, \ncosts, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders’ equity. We \nreflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to \nfunctional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in OI&E.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update \n(ASU) 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" to expand the disclosure \nrequirements for income taxes. Upon adoption we will be required to disclose additional specified categories in the rate \nreconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. We will also be required to disclose the amount of income taxes \npaid disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. The standard can be applied either \nprospectively or retrospectively. We will adopt the standard in our 2025 annual period and are currently assessing the \neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 \"Income Statement: Reporting Comprehensive Income-\nExpense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)\" to improve the disclosures about an entity’s expenses. Upon \nadoption, we will be required to disclose in the notes to the financial statements a disaggregation of certain expense \ncategories included within the expense captions on the face of the income statement. The standard is effective for our \n2027 annual period, and our interim periods beginning in 2028, with early adoption permitted. The standard can be \napplied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently assessing adoption timing and the effect that the \nupdated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07 “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to \nReportable Segment Disclosures” which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, \nprimarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.

Revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services \nthat have not yet been recognized as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as \nrevenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. The estimated revenue backlog and \ntiming of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with \nrelevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue \ncurrently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original \nexpected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including \namounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, \nplatforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $5.0 billion, of which $3.9 billion was \nrecognized as revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2024 was \n$6.0 billion. \nNote 3.

For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which \nchanges in fair value are recorded in OI&E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the \nunrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.\nThe following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities measured at fair value on \na recurring basis (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2023\nFair Value \nHierarchy\nAdjusted \nCost\nGross \nUnrealized \nGains\nGross \nUnrealized \nLosses\nFair Value\nCash and \nCash \nEquivalents\nMarketable \nSecurities\nFair value changes \nrecorded in other \ncomprehensive income\nTime deposits\nLevel 2\n$ \n2,628 \n$ \n0 \n$ \n0 \n$ \n2,628 \n$ \n2,628 $ \n0 \nGovernment bonds\nLevel 2\n38,106\n \n233 \n \n(679)  \n37,660 \n \n1,993  \n35,667 \nCorporate debt securities\nLevel 2\n22,457\n \n112 \n \n(637)  \n21,932 \n \n0  \n21,932 \nMortgage-backed and \nasset-backed securities\nLevel 2\n17,243\n \n88 \n \n(634)  \n16,697 \n \n0  \n16,697 \nTotal investments with \nfair value change \nreflected in other \ncomprehensive \nincome(1)\n \n80,434 \n \n433 \n \n(1,950)  \n78,917 \n \n4,621  \n74,296 \nFair value adjustments \nrecorded in net income\nMoney market funds\nLevel 1\n \n6,480 \n \n6,480  \n0 \nCurrent marketable \nequity securities(2)\nLevel 1\n \n4,282 \n \n0  \n4,282 \nMutual funds\nLevel 2\n \n311 \n \n0  \n311 \nGovernment bonds\nLevel 2\n \n1,952 \n \n347  \n1,605 \nCorporate debt securities\nLevel 2\n \n3,782 \n \n91  \n3,691 \nMortgage-backed and \nasset-backed securities\nLevel 2\n \n2,683 \n \n0  \n2,683 \nTotal investments with \nfair value change \nrecorded in net \nincome\n \n19,490 \n \n6,918  \n12,572 \nCash\n \n0 \n \n12,509  \n0 \nTotal\n$ \n80,434 \n$ \n433 \n$ \n(1,950) $ \n98,407 \n$ \n24,048 $ \n86,868 \n(1)\nRepresents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to AOCI.\n(2)\nThe long-term portion of marketable equity securities (subject to long-term lock-up restrictions) of $1.4 billion as of \nDecember 31, 2023 is included within other non-current assets.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n65.  \n\nAs of December 31, 2024\nFair Value \nHierarchy\nAdjusted \nCost\nGross \nUnrealized \nGains\nGross \nUnrealized \nLosses\nFair Value\nCash and \nCash \nEquivalents\nMarketable \nSecurities\nFair value changes \nrecorded in other \ncomprehensive income\nTime deposits\nLevel 2\n$ \n2,217 \n$ \n0 \n$ \n0 \n$ \n2,217 \n$ \n2,081 $ \n136 \nGovernment bonds\nLevel 2\n \n27,551 \n \n83 \n \n(214)  \n27,420 \n \n50  \n27,370 \nCorporate debt securities\nLevel 2\n \n18,300 \n \n79 \n \n(222)  \n18,157 \n \n0  \n18,157 \nMortgage-backed and \nasset-backed securities\nLevel 2\n \n14,437 \n \n63 \n \n(385)  \n14,115 \n \n0  \n14,115 \nTotal investments with \nfair value change \nreflected in other \ncomprehensive \nincome(1)\n \n62,505 \n \n225 \n \n(821)  \n61,909 \n \n2,131  \n59,778 \nFair value adjustments \nrecorded in net income\nMoney market funds\nLevel 1\n$ \n8,154 \n$ \n8,154 $ \n0 \nCurrent marketable \nequity securities(2)\nLevel 1\n4,708\n \n0 \n4,708\nMutual funds\nLevel 2\n105\n \n0 \n105\nGovernment bonds\nLevel 2\n2,035\n \n696 \n1,339\nCorporate debt securities\nLevel 2\n3,037\n \n78 \n2,959\nMortgage-backed and \nasset-backed securities\nLevel 2\n3,302\n \n0 \n3,302\nTotal investments with \nfair value change \nrecorded in net \nincome\n \n21,341 \n \n8,928  \n12,413 \nCash\n \n0 \n \n12,407  \n0 \nTotal\n$ \n62,505 \n$ \n225 \n$ \n(821) $ \n83,250 \n$ \n23,466 $ \n72,191 \n(1)\nRepresents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to AOCI.\n(2)\nThe long-term portion of marketable equity securities (subject to long-term lock-up restrictions) of $266 million as of \nDecember 31, 2024 is included within other non-current assets.\nInvestments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable \nmarket values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable \ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities \nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 \nin the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are \nclassified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, and \ncommon stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the \ntransaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the rights \nand obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs vary significantly based on investment type.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $35.5 billion, of which \n$19.9 billion were remeasured at fair value during the year ended December 31, 2024, and were primarily classified \nwithin Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.\nDebt Securities\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of investments in available-for-sale marketable debt \nsecurities by effective contractual maturity dates (in millions):\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n66.  \n\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2024\nDue in 1 year or less\n$ \n6,341 \nDue in 1 year through 5 years\n \n37,221 \nDue in 5 years through 10 years\n \n10,920 \nDue after 10 years\n \n12,896 \nTotal\n$ \n67,378 \nThe following tables present fair values and gross unrealized losses recorded to AOCI, aggregated by \ninvestment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in \nmillions):\n \nAs of December 31, 2023\n \nLess than 12 Months\n12 Months or Greater\nTotal\n \nFair Value\nUnrealized\nLoss\nFair Value\nUnrealized\nLoss\nFair Value\nUnrealized\nLoss\nGovernment bonds\n$ \n1,456 $ \n(22) $ \n13,897 $ \n(657) $ \n15,353 $ \n(679) \nCorporate debt securities\n \n827  \n(5)  \n15,367  \n(592)  \n16,194  \n(597) \nMortgage-backed and asset-backed \nsecurities\n \n2,945  \n(26)  \n7,916  \n(608)  \n10,861  \n(634) \nTotal\n$ \n5,228 $ \n(53) $ \n37,180 $ \n(1,857) $ \n42,408 $ \n(1,910) \n \nAs of December 31, 2024\n \nLess than 12 Months\n12 Months or Greater\nTotal\n \nFair Value\nUnrealized\nLoss\nFair Value\nUnrealized\nLoss\nFair Value\nUnrealized\nLoss\nGovernment bonds\n$ \n11,119 $ \n(126) $ \n2,576 $ \n(88) $ \n13,695 $ \n(214) \nCorporate debt securities\n \n4,228  \n(17)  \n6,838  \n(168)  \n11,066  \n(185) \nMortgage-backed and asset-backed \nsecurities\n \n5,222  \n(106)  \n3,813  \n(279)  \n9,035  \n(385) \nTotal\n$ \n20,569 $ \n(249) $ \n13,227 $ \n(535) $ \n33,796 $ \n(784) \nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale or extinguishment of debt securities on a specific identification \nmethod.

While these net gains (losses) may have been reflected in periods prior to the period of sale, we \nbelieve they are important supplemental information as they reflect the economic net gains (losses) on the securities \nsold during the period.

See Note 7 for further details on OI&E. \nCertain of our equity method securities include our investments in VIEs where we are not the primary beneficiary. See \nNote 4 for further details on VIEs.\nConvertible Notes\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024, we had investments in convertible notes of $921 million and \n$2.9 billion, respectively, the majority of which are convertible notes held for investment. Our convertible notes held for \ninvestment are recorded at amortized cost which includes unpaid principal balances, deferred origination costs, and \nany related discount or premium, net of allowances for credit losses, and are included within other non-current assets \non our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n68.  \n\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk \nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, \nand investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We \nalso enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives \nprimarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a \ncombination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. \nThe accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge \ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have \nmaturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and \nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and \ntime value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the \nhedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the \namount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect \nwas $731 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our \nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the \nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related \nhedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the \nexcluded component in OI&E.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks \nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge \neffectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward \npoints from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&E.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to \nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the \nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting \nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and \nliabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, \ncommodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into \nderivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from \nother derivatives are primarily reflected within the “other” component of OI&E.

Variable Interest Entities \nConsolidated VIEs\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n73.  \n\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of \noperations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. \nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to us. \nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $4.9 billion \nand $8.7 billion, respectively and are primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance \nSheets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 \nbillion and $2.3 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included \nwithin Other Bets.\nWaymo, a fully autonomous driving technology company and a consolidated VIE, received $5.6 billion in funding \nduring the year ended December 31, 2024, the majority of which was funded by Alphabet. Investments from external \nparties were accounted for as equity transactions and resulted in recognition of noncontrolling interests.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were \n$3.4 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion was redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI) for both \nperiods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests \nwas not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 7 for further \ndetails on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies \nthat are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power \ngeneration using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that \nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of \noperations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account \nfor these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which are included \nwithin non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure of these \nunconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding \ncommitments. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, our future funding commitments related to unconsolidated VIE \ninvestments were $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. \nNote 6.

The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula \nusing certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts \nwere outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\nNote 7.

Commitments and Contingencies \nCommitments\nWe have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $8.8 billion as of \nDecember 31, 2024, of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate \nactivities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, \ncustomers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed \nto defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or \nout of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit \nthe time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered \ninto indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification \nobligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification \nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the \npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, \ncash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future \npayments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows \nin a particular period.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably \npossible.\nLegal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be \nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be \nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect \nthe amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses \ndisclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial \nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine \nboth the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be \nunable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are \ninherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in aggregate, have a \nmaterial adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nAntitrust Matters\nWe are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations as well as litigation on various competition \nmatters by regulatory authorities and private parties in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally, including the \nfollowing:\n•\nShopping: In June 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google relating to its \ndisplay and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European antitrust laws and imposed a €2.4 \nbillion fine. We appealed the EC decision and implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n78.  \n\ncompliance with the EC's decision. In September 2024, the European Court of Justice rejected our appeal and \nupheld the €2.4 billion fine. In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the fine. \n•\nAndroid: In July 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related \ndistribution agreements infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a €4.3 billion fine, and directed the \ntermination of the conduct at issue. We appealed the EC decision and implemented changes to certain of our \nAndroid distribution practices. In September 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but reduced the \nfine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation of the EC \ndecision with the European Court of Justice, which remains pending. In 2018, we recognized a charge of \n$5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\n•\nAdSense for Search: In March 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google's \nagreements with AdSense for Search partners infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a fine of €1.5 billion, \nand directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the \ndecision. In 2019, we recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine and appealed the EC decision. In \nSeptember 2024, the General Court overturned the EC decision and annulled the €1.5 billion fine. The EC has \nappealed the General Court's decision with the European Court of Justice.\n•\nSearch: In October 2020, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Columbia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and \nSearch advertising. In August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google \nviolated such U.S. antitrust laws. A separate proceeding is being held to determine remedies, the range of \nwhich vary widely. The DOJ has proposed a high level remedy framework, which includes alterations to our \nproducts and services and our business models and operations, including structural remedies, and/or our \ndistribution arrangements, among other changes, some of which could have a material adverse effect on our \nbusiness. We have filed our own remedies proposal ahead of a hearing on remedies in April 2025. We expect \na decision likely in the second half of 2025, after which we intend to appeal.\nFurther, in June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and in October 2023, the \nJapanese Fair Trade Commission each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\nGiven the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n•\nAdvertising Technology: In December 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state \ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025. Additionally, \nin January 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to its \nadvertising technology, and a number of additional state Attorneys General subsequently joined the lawsuit. \nThe trial ended in September 2024, and we expect a decision in early 2025. \nFurther, in June 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections informing Google of its preliminary view that \nGoogle violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology, to which we responded. \nGiven the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n•\nGoogle Play: In July 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the \nNorthern District of California alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. \nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement \nin principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories and recognized a charge. Final approval of the \nsettlement remains pending before the court. In May 2024, we funded the settlement amount to an escrow \nagent. \nIn December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated \nU.S. antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages. The presiding \njudge issued a remedies decision in October 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our business models and \noperations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing the verdict and the trial \ncourt judge temporarily paused the implementation of the remedies while the Court of Appeals considers our \nrequest to pause implementation of the remedies pending the duration of the appeal. Given the nature of this \nmatter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n79.  \n\n•\nEuropean Digital Markets Act: In March 2024, the EC opened two investigations regarding Google's \ncompliance with certain provisions of EU's Digital Markets Act relating to Google Play and Search. Given the \npreliminary stages of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\nIn addition to these proceedings, private individual and collective actions that overlap with claims pursued by \nregulatory authorities are pending in the U.S. and in several other jurisdictions. \nWe believe we have strong arguments against these open claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We \ncontinue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPrivacy Matters\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of \nprivacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations and \nlitigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information, alleged \nviolations of state biometric statutes, the choices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could result in \nsignificant fines, judgments, and product changes.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that \ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these \nlawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders \npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change \nour business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for \nus and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly \nbecome an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can \nresult in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a \nprohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important \nproducts into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products. Further, our \ncustomers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions \nor otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, \nand consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, \nlabor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by \nadvertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, \nwe periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, consent \norders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and \npenalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, \nalterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, \nall of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, some matters concern civil judgments that \ninclude compounding penalties imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, \nincluding those of sanctioned parties. We do not expect these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse \neffect.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The \nsubject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the \nsale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue \nnon-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when \na loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of \nloss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of \nthese matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our \nexpectations.\nSee Note 14 for information regarding income tax contingencies.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n80.  \n\nNote 11.        Stockholders' Equity \nClass A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C \ncapital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect \nto voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock \nis entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law. \nShares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically \nconvert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\nShare Repurchases\nIn the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we continued to repurchase both Class A and Class C \nshares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic \ncost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C \nshares. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we repurchased $59.3 billion, $62.2 billion, and \n$62.0 billion, respectively, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.\nIn April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 \nbillion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2024, $44.7 billion remained available for Class A and \nClass C share repurchases. \nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nShares\nAmount\nShares\nAmount\nClass A share repurchases\n78\n$ \n9,316 \n73\n$ \n11,855 \nClass C share repurchases\n450\n \n52,868 \n306\n \n50,192 \nTotal share repurchases(1)\n528\n$ \n62,184 \n379\n$ \n62,047 \n(1)         Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases.\nRepurchases are executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other \ninvestment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule \n10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.\nDividends\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, total cash dividends, which were first paid in June 2024, were $3.5 \nbillion, $519 million, and $3.3 billion for Class A, Class B, and Class C shares, respectively.\nThe company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the \ncompany’s Board of Directors in its sole discretion.\nNote 12.        Net Income Per Share \nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net \nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net \nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive \nsecurities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of RSUs and other contingently issuable \nshares. The dilutive effect of outstanding RSUs and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings \nper share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A \nstock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not \nassume the conversion of those shares.\nIn accordance with our certificate of incorporation, the rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the \nholders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are \na number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of \nDirectors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. \nSpecifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of \nadversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock \nadversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any \nsuch amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of \nDirectors. \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n81.  \n\nImmaterial differences in net income per share across our Class A, Class B, and Class C shares may arise due to \nthe allocation of distributed earnings, which is based on the holders as of the record date, compared with the allocation \nof undistributed earnings and number of shares, which is based on the weighted average shares outstanding over the \nperiods.\nThe following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A, Class B, and \nClass C stock (in millions, except per share amounts):\n \n \nYear Ended

Compensation Plans \nStock Plans\nOur stock plans include the Alphabet Amended and Restated 2021 Stock Plan (\"Alphabet 2021 Stock Plan\") and \nOther Bets stock-based plans. Under our stock plans, RSUs and other types of awards may be granted. Under the \nAlphabet 2021 Stock Plan, an RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our Class C stock at the time the award \nvests. RSUs generally vest over four years contingent upon employment on the vesting date. RSUs are awarded \ndividend equivalents, which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying award, and settled in Class C \nshares.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were 633 million shares of Class C stock reserved for future issuance under the \nAlphabet 2021 Stock Plan.\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, total SBC expense was $19.5 billion, $22.1 billion, and \n$22.8 billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $18.8 billion, $21.7 \nbillion, and $22.0 billion, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we recognized tax benefits on total SBC expense, \nwhich are reflected in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income, of $3.9 billion, $4.5 \nbillion, and $4.6 billion, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, tax benefit realized related to awards vested or \nexercised during the period was $4.7 billion, $5.6 billion, and $6.8 billion, respectively. These amounts do not include \nthe indirect effects of stock-based awards, which primarily relate to the R&D tax credit.\nStock-Based Award Activities\nThe following table summarizes the activities for unvested Alphabet RSUs, which include dividend equivalents \nawarded to holders of unvested stock, for the year ended December 31, 2024 (in millions, except per share amounts):\n \n    Number of    \nShares\nWeighted-\nAverage\nGrant-Date\nFair Value\nUnvested as of December 31, 2023\n \n338 $ \n104.93 \nGranted\n \n195 $ \n140.04 \nVested\n \n(199) $ \n110.89 \nForfeited/canceled\n \n(35) $ \n113.52 \nUnvested as of December 31, 2024\n \n299 $ \n122.77 \nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2022 and \n2023 was $127.22 and $97.59, respectively. Total fair value of RSUs, as of their respective vesting dates, during the \nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, were $23.9 billion, $26.6 billion, and $33.3 billion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there was $34.8 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs. \nThis amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years. \nNote 14.

Significant components \nof our deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n2023\n2024\nDeferred tax assets:\nAccrued employee benefits\n$ \n1,855 $ \n1,834 \nAccruals and reserves not currently deductible\n \n2,481  \n2,552 \nTax credits\n \n6,609  \n6,384 \nNet operating losses\n \n2,965  \n3,472 \nOperating leases\n \n3,526  \n3,336 \nCapitalized research and development\n \n17,757  \n25,903 \nOther\n \n1,951  \n1,376 \nTotal deferred tax assets\n \n37,144  \n44,857 \nValuation allowance\n \n(10,999)  \n(11,493) \nTotal deferred tax assets net of valuation allowance\n \n26,145  \n33,364 \nDeferred tax liabilities:\nProperty and equipment, net\n \n(8,189)  \n(9,932) \nNet investment gains\n \n(2,405)  \n(2,978) \nOperating leases\n \n(2,965)  \n(2,986) \nOther\n \n(902)  \n(1,008) \nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n \n(14,461)  \n(16,904) \nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities)\n$ \n11,684 $ \n16,460 \nAs of December 31, 2024, our federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax \npurposes were approximately $8.4 billion, $19.4 billion, and $2.5 billion respectively. If not utilized, the federal net \noperating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025, foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in \n2025 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2033. It is more likely than not that the \nmajority of the net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to \nvarious annual limitations under the tax laws of the different jurisdictions.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our Federal and California research and development credit carryforwards for income \ntax purposes were approximately $700 million and $6.4 billion, respectively. If not utilized, the Federal R&D credit will \nbegin to expire in 2037 and the California R&D credit can be carried over indefinitely. We believe the majority of the \nfederal tax credit and state tax credit is not likely to be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our investment tax credit carryforwards for state income tax purposes were \napproximately $1.2 billion and will begin to expire in 2030. We use the flow-through method of accounting for \ninvestment tax credits. We believe this tax credit is not likely to be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to California deferred tax assets, \ncertain federal net operating losses, certain state net operating losses and tax credits, net deferred tax assets relating \nto Other Bet companies, and certain foreign net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized. We \ncontinue to reassess the remaining valuation allowance quarterly, and if future evidence allows for a partial or full \nrelease of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly. \nCash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, was $18.9 billion, $19.2 billion, and $27.4 billion as of December 31, \n2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n86.  \n\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\n \n2022\n2023\n2024\nBeginning gross unrecognized tax benefits\n$ \n5,158 $ \n7,055 $ \n9,438 \nIncreases related to prior year tax positions\n \n253  \n740  \n896 \nDecreases related to prior year tax positions\n \n(437)  \n(682)  \n(83) \nDecreases related to settlement with tax authorities\n \n(140)  \n(21)  \n(311) \nIncreases related to current year tax positions\n \n2,221  \n2,346  \n2,679 \nEnding gross unrecognized tax benefits\n$ \n7,055 $ \n9,438 $ \n12,619 \nYear Ended December 31,\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating \nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax \nbenefits was $7.1 billion, $9.4 billion, and $12.6 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively, of \nwhich $5.3 billion, $7.4 billion, and $10.0 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively. \nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we accrued $622 million and $1.1 billion in interest and penalties in provision \nfor income taxes, respectively.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two \nmajor tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax \nreturns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2021 tax returns. We \nhave also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or \npermanent establishment. We continue to defend such claims as presented.\nThe tax years 2016 through 2023 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for \nIrish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial \nstatements.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the \nadequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax \nauthorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. \nHowever, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are \nresolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for \nincome taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is \nnot certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, \nstate, and non U.S. tax positions will materially change in the next 12 months. \nNote 15.        Information about Segments and Geographic Areas \nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n•\nGoogle Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps, \nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees \nreceived for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and \nNFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases; and devices.\n•\nGoogle Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, applications, and other services for enterprise \ncustomers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions \nreceived for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and \nother enterprise services.\n•\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from \nOther Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering \nactivities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the \nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are \nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation, are allocated to \noperating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n87.  \n\nAs announced in April 2024, we consolidated teams that focus on building general AI models across Google \nResearch and Google DeepMind to further accelerate our progress in AI. General AI model development teams \npreviously under Google Research in our Google Services segment are reported within Alphabet-level activities \nprospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2024. As further announced, in October 2024, the Gemini app team \nthat is developing the direct consumer interface to our Gemini models joined Google DeepMind. The costs associated \nwith the Gemini app team continue to be reported within our Google Services segment.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs \nprimarily include certain AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; \ncorporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human \nresource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and \noffice space reductions during 2023 and 2024 were also not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains \n(losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\nOur Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our Chief Executive Officer, Sundar Pichai. Our CODM uses \nsegment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to our segments in our annual planning process and to assess \nthe performance of our segments, primarily by monitoring actual results versus the annual plan. Our operating \nsegments are not evaluated using asset information.\nThe following table presents revenue, profitability, and expense information about our segments (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022\n2023\n2024\nRevenues:\nGoogle Services\n$ \n253,528 $ \n272,543 $ \n304,930 \nGoogle Cloud\n \n26,280  \n33,088  \n43,229 \nOther Bets\n \n1,068  \n1,527  \n1,648 \nHedging gains (losses)\n \n1,960  \n236  \n211 \nTotal revenues\n$ \n282,836 $ \n307,394 $ \n350,018 \nOperating income (loss):\nGoogle Services\n$ \n82,699 $ \n95,858 $ \n121,263 \nGoogle Cloud\n \n(1,922)  \n1,716  \n6,112 \nOther Bets\n \n(4,636)  \n(4,095)  \n(4,444) \nAlphabet-level activities\n \n(1,299)  \n(9,186)  \n(10,541) \nTotal income from operations\n$ \n74,842 $ \n84,293 $ \n112,390 \nSupplemental information about our segment expenses:\nGoogle Services:\nEmployee compensation expenses\n$ \n43,529 $ \n46,224 $ \n44,560 \nOther costs and expenses\n \n127,300  \n130,461  \n139,107 \nTotal Google Services costs and expenses\n$ \n170,829 $ \n176,685 $ \n183,667 \nGoogle Cloud:\nEmployee compensation expenses\n$ \n16,132 $ \n19,054 $ \n20,519 \nOther costs and expenses\n \n12,070  \n12,318  \n16,598 \nTotal Google Cloud costs and expenses\n$ \n28,202 $ \n31,372 $ \n37,117 \nGoogle Services and Google Cloud employee compensation expenses include the costs associated with direct \nand allocated employees.

Additionally, Google Services other costs and expenses \ninclude content and traffic acquisition costs and device costs.\nSee Note 2 for information relating to revenues by geography.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n88.  \n\nThe following table presents long-lived assets by geographic area, which includes property and equipment, net \nand operating lease assets (in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n \n2023\n2024\nLong-lived assets:\nUnited States\n$ \n110,053 $ \n138,993 \nInternational\n \n38,383  \n45,631 \nTotal long-lived assets\n$ \n148,436 $ \n184,624 \nNote 16.        Subsequent Event \nIn January 2025, we recognized an $8.0 billion unrealized gain on our non-marketable equity securities related to \nour investment in a private company. The unrealized gain reflects an increase in the fair value measurement of our \ninvestment following an observable transaction in January 2025.

Our management conducted an evaluation of the \neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated \nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). \nBased on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of \nDecember 31, 2024. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit and Compliance Committee. \nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Ernst & \nYoung LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls \nand procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the \ndesired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there \nare resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible \ncontrols and procedures relative to their costs.\nITEM 9B.\nOTHER INFORMATION\n10b5-1 Trading Plans\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, each of the following Section 16 director and officer adopted, \nmodified, or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the \nExchange Act):\n•\nJohn Hennessy, Chair of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, through the John L.

As stock units are not outstanding shares of stock and thus would not otherwise be entitled to \nparticipate in any dividends, the crediting of dividend equivalent units is intended to preserve the equity-based \nincentives intended by the company when the stock units were granted and to treat the holders of unvested stock units \nconsistently with all stockholders.\nRequired Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act\nAs previously disclosed, Google LLC, a subsidiary of Alphabet, filed notifications with the Russian Federal \nSecurity Service (FSB) pursuant to Russian encryption control requirements, which must be complied with prior to the \nimport of covered items.
